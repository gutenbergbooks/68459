<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> various adventures which have befallen
Bob Somers and his fellow members of the
club which the boys formed at Kingswood,
Wisconsin, are related in “The Rambler Club
Afloat,” “The Rambler Club’s Winter Camp,”
“The Rambler Club in the Mountains,” “The
Rambler Club on Circle T Ranch,” “The
Rambler Club among the Lumberjacks,” “The
Rambler Club’s Gold Mine,” “The Rambler
Club’s Aeroplane” and “The Rambler Club’s
House-Boat.”</p>

<p>Bob Somers, Dave Brandon and Tom Clifton,
three members of the club, have reached
Chicago, homeward bound after a trip up the
Hudson. The characters of the boys are widely
different. Bob Somers is strong and athletic,
while stout Dave Brandon, inclined to take
his ease on all possible occasions, can be remarkably
active when circumstances demand.
Tom Clifton, a trifle self-conscious, and sometimes
allowing his enthusiasm to carry him
away, is really not so vain as many think.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Dave Brandon, poet and historian of the
club, who is chronicling the various incidents
and adventures that befall them, feels that
their present motor car trip will add but little
to his book. A series of unlooked-for events,
however, quite reverse this idea.</p>

<p>In the next book, “The Rambler Club’s
Ball Nine,” is told the story of certain incidents
at the Kingswood high school. Several
of the best players have graduated, and in
their attempts to reorganize the team the
Ramblers find themselves involved in a stormy
and exciting struggle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>OFF TO WISCONSIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the steps of a house on Michigan Avenue,
Chicago, not far from Thirtieth Street,
Victor Collins stood gazing up and down the
wide thoroughfare. There was an expression
in his eyes which seemed to indicate an earnest
and expectant state of mind.</p>

<p>The steps belonged to a fine mansion with
handsome columns on either side of the entrance
and an ornate balcony above. Everything
suggested that the neighborhood was
the home of wealth and aristocracy. Even
the lad on the steps fitted perfectly into the
picture. His rather small, slight figure was
dressed in a natty brown suit, while a cap—a
very large checkered cap—rested jauntily on
his neatly brushed hair. Victor Collins’ features<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
were well proportioned, although the
curves were rather too dainty, perhaps, to suit
the idea of some critical lads.</p>

<p>Victor was becoming impatient. Impatience
was one of his principal characteristics.
Waiting is tedious. So Victor tilted his cap
far back, the process revealing two frowning
lines on his forehead which, considering his
age, should never have existed.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the lad’s peace of mind,
however, the vigorous honk, honk of a motor
car, rising above all other sounds in the street,
suddenly caused his gaze to become centered
upon the approaching machine.</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness, here they are at
last!” he exclaimed, joyfully.</p>

<p>Running down the steps he reached the
curb just as a big touring car swung up alongside
and came to a stop.</p>

<p>“All ready, Victor?” called the chauffeur,
a broad-shouldered, healthy-looking lad, leaping
to the ground.</p>

<p>There was no answer, because at the same
instant three other boys, with much noise and
laughter, began climbing out.</p>

<p>The youngest was very tall and thin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
this was accentuated by the stoutness of a
broadly smiling lad who stood close beside
him. The fourth member of the group, a
slender, sandy-haired boy, appeared to be
about sixteen. His broad forehead and delicately
chiseled features suggested fine intellect.</p>

<p>The first three, Bob Somers, Tom Clifton
and Dave Brandon, were members of the
Rambler Club, who, having made a house-boat
trip up the Hudson, had reached Chicago
en route to Wisconsin. Charlie Blake, their
companion, a classmate, often referred to as
the “grind,” on account of his studious habits,
was on a visit to his friend, Victor Collins.</p>

<p>It naturally followed that the Ramblers,
happening to be in Chicago at the same time,
received an invitation to visit the Collins
mansion. And it also followed that, as the
Ramblers were going to have the use of a
seven passenger touring car, Victor Collins
was more than pleased to meet them.</p>

<p>Mr. Somers, Bob’s father, having motored
to Chicago on business, returned by train,
leaving the car at a garage, so that the boys
might use it for the remainder of the journey
to Kingswood, Wisconsin, their home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>When Victor Collins learned of this intention
he instantly announced a determination
to go with the crowd as far as Kenosha.</p>

<p>“You see,” he explained to Bob Somers,
“my Uncle Ralph lives there; and he owns
the dandiest motor yacht your eyes ever
looked upon. He’s invited me to take a trip
to Milwaukee. Talk about sport!”</p>

<p>So the morning had come when Victor’s
anticipations were about to be realized.</p>

<p>“You’re all as brown as a bunch of street
cleaners,” he remarked, after salutations had
been exchanged. “I don’t believe that sun-tinting
will ever wear off, either. Hello, Hannibal,
hello!”</p>

<p>He turned and faced the house.</p>

<p>A very dignified colored man, wearing an
immaculately clean apron, had opened the
door and was standing with a large suit case
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Bring it down and chuck it into the car,”
commanded Victor.</p>

<p>“An awful lot of stuff for a short trip,” remarked
Tom. “You ought to throw out half.”</p>

<p>“Fade away,” retorted Victor. “There’s another
one coming.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Mercy!” snickered Tom. “Why don’t
you bring a department store along?”</p>

<p>Hannibal made short work of depositing
the heavy suit cases in the tonneau. Then,
grinning broadly, he drew forth a letter and
handed it to Charlie Blake.</p>

<p>“It am just come, suh,” he explained.</p>

<p>“The handwriting spells Kirk Talbot’s
name as loud as those checks on Victor’s cap,
fellows,” cried Blake.</p>

<p>“Kirk Talbot?” queried Tom, interestedly.
“We met Kirk often on one of our trips.
Remember, Bob?”</p>

<p>Bob did, and smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry that he and Nat Wingate won’t
be back in the school this term,” he remarked.
“By the way, Dave, we’ll have to hustle to
catch up with our studies.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Bob. Just think of how
the doors of that school are yawning for us
even now.”</p>

<p>“They’ll have to yawn a mighty big, wide
yawn for you,” said Victor.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Charlie, read that letter out
loud,” cried Tom.</p>

<p>Blake was soon smiling broadly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Kirk has a few interesting knocks to hand
out, Bob,” he chuckled. “Just listen:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Charlie</span>:—</p>

<p>“‘Your last effusion is lying on my
desk. So you are actually going to meet
Bob Somers and his chums! Say, don’t
those chaps manage to have the finest time
ever, with their aeroplanes, house-boats, automobiles
and a dash of cowboy life in between!</p>

<p>“‘And you are going to motor back to
Kingswood with them! That’s great.</p>

<p>“‘But I’ve got a bit of news which ought
to make Bob Somers sit up and take notice.
Nat Wingate and I have formed a football
team. Yes, it’s true. There’s a lot of good
material going to waste here in town. And
the high school team has had its own way so
long it’s time somebody took them down a peg.
And though we really hate to do it those
chaps are in for the worst drubbing of their
career, and we’re even talking about a ball
nine next spring.’”</p>

<p>“Are we going to stay here all day?”
grumbled Victor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Just a few moments, Vic,” laughed Charlie,
resuming:</p>

<p>“‘Now that Nat Wingate has gone those
high school chaps are like an army without
a general.’”</p>

<p>“Huh!” remarked Tom, frowning slightly.</p>

<p>“‘Now, Charlie, here’s what Nat and I
think. Bob Somers and his Rambler crowd
may be pretty good at bowling over grizzlies,
collecting panther skins, or busting bronchos,
but when it comes to either football or baseball——’”</p>

<p>“Well, I like that!” broke in Tom indignantly.</p>

<p>“Prepare yourself for the worst,” laughed
Charlie. “Listen to this:</p>

<p>“‘I guess they are simply out of the running?’”</p>

<p>“Did you ever, Bob Somers!” cried Tom.
“The nerve of him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry. I guess the high school
eleven can take care of any crowd he brings,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“There are some pretty good baseball
players, though, in Kingswood,” said Tom.
“I guess it’s up to us to take hold next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
spring and put a little ginger into our
crowd.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t quite the shape for a ball
player, Clifton,” remarked Victor, with a
critical stare.</p>

<p>“Humph!” sniffed Tom.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, finish that letter,
Blake,” continued Victor, with a grin.</p>

<p>“‘I hear that the Kingswood High has a
chance to get an athletic field,’” read Charlie.
“‘Mr. Rupert Barry owns a large plot of
ground which ought to make a dandy ball
park. But, so far, it is only a rumor, and
maybe a silly one, at that. You would think
so if you saw some of the playing the K. H. S.
has done recently.</p>

<p>“‘Tell Bob Somers what I said. Good-bye
and good luck.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“‘Your old chum,</span><br />
“‘<span class="smcap">Kirk</span>.’”</p>
</div>

<p>“A nice long letter,” drawled Dave.</p>

<p>“Is that all you have to say about it?” demanded
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom,” said Dave, slowly, “your suggestion
needs consideration.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“You haven’t quite the shape for a ball
player either, Brandon,” said Victor.</p>

<p>“Goodness—Dave’s turn now!” snickered
Tom. “What kind of a figure must a ball
tosser have, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Somers is about right,” answered Victor,
calmly. “But a chap that is either all bones
or all fat won’t do.”</p>

<p>“We’ll show you some day,” snapped Tom,
hotly.</p>

<p>Baseball was a rather sore subject with
Charlie Blake. He had tried it the season
before, but lack of confidence in himself
speedily caused him to drop out of the game.</p>

<p>Some of the boys who were not of a very
considerate nature concluded that Charlie had
a yellow streak, and, at this point, Bob Somers
earned Blake’s everlasting gratitude by sticking
manfully to him.</p>

<p>“Say,” remarked the latter, rather dolefully,
“I’m sorry I didn’t make good on the
nine last year. I certainly tried hard enough.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you didn’t have the right kind of
a figure,” said Tom, with tremendous sarcasm.</p>

<p>“A nice thing to waste all this time,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
grunted Victor. “We ought to be burning
up some of those country roads.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” laughed Bob Somers. “Pile
in, fellows.”</p>

<p>His eyes sparkled as they ran over the
graceful lines of the big touring machine. It
was finished in a deep, rich red, relieved by
touches of darker color. Polished lamps,
steering gear and levers, in places, shot back
the rays of the early morning sun.</p>

<p>It was something to feel that they were
actually in possession of such a magnificent
car—theirs to command, theirs to take them
where they willed, and theirs to defy distance,
time, and railroads.</p>

<p>Mrs. Collins was looking out of a second
story window.</p>

<p>An instant later, Victor, from his place on
the rear cushion, shouted:</p>

<p>“Good-bye, mother!”</p>

<p>“Have you all those warm wraps and the
umbrella I told you to take?” she called.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother!”</p>

<p>“And that bottle of beef tea, and your raincoat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“And will you be sure to use the cough
medicine in case you catch cold?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother!”</p>

<p>“Well, do be careful, Victor. And don’t
fail to send a card home this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Victor promised, his face glowing with anticipation.</p>

<p>“We are going to have a ripping time,
mother!” he shouted. “Hooray! Let her
whizz, Somers!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE FIRST LAP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> crisp staccato notes of the motor suddenly
drowned the sound of his voice. From
the exhaust poured a bluish haze of gasoline
vapor. The car apparently became vibrant
with life and energy. Then, as the rapid-fire
roar quickly lessened to a low musical drone,
Bob Somers threw in the clutch.</p>

<p>In the midst of a chorus of good-byes, the
motor car began to glide smoothly away, and,
upon looking back, the boys saw the lady at
the window waving her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t this just stunning!” cried Victor.
“Hit it up, Somers.”</p>

<p>Row after row of residences seemed to be
drawn swiftly toward them and sent slipping
behind. At each street crossing Bob slowed
up, allowing the boys momentary views of
Lake Michigan, only a short distance away.</p>

<p>The few vehicles and pedestrians about appeared
as mere crawling things whenever the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
high-powered car leaped forward in obedience
to the summons of its master’s hand.</p>

<p>Victor Collins experienced a delightful sense
of ease and comfort as he watched the passing
show with all the zest and interest that novelty
often brings.</p>

<p>“Go it, Somers, go it!” he urged. “Whoop
it up like sixty!”</p>

<p>“Restraint and caution should ever be the
chauffeur’s watchword,” drawled Dave.</p>

<p>“That’s what I think, too,” approved
Charlie.</p>

<p>“In cities they always have so many laws
to bother a chap,” grumbled Tom. “Why,
when we were in Wyoming——”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it, son,” interrupted Victor.
“This beats all your old cowboy business to
pieces.”</p>

<p>The residential section of Michigan Avenue
had been passed. The motor car was now
swinging along by the side of Grant Park.
Out over the lake they could see that the
stiff breeze was kicking up the water into
choppy waves and tossing about several small
boats whose sails cut crisply white against the
background. The far-reaching stretch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
water, in the early morning light, became
lost in a scintillating haze which dazzled the
eye.</p>

<p>“The clouds are piling up,” remarked Dave.
“I guess we’ll have some stormy weather
soon.”</p>

<p>A succession of views passed so rapidly that
the eye could take in only their salient features.
Almost before they realized it the boys were
being carried across the Chicago River. One
look showed them an insignificant tug struggling
valiantly with a huge, clumsy barge, a
myriad of masts, a kaleidoscopic effect of hulls,
docks and buildings, with here and there
clouds of smoke and steam. Then all was
whirled behind them.</p>

<p>“What time shall we get to Kenosha,
Somers?” demanded Victor.</p>

<p>“About one o’clock, if everything goes well,”
answered Bob.</p>

<p>He put on his goggles, for occasionally the
breeze brought with it a shower of flying
particles.</p>

<p>“Good! Then we can slip over to Uncle
Ralph’s motor yacht. Did you speak, sir?”</p>

<p>“I did,” answered Tom, with dignity. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
said it might be a good idea for the bunch to
stop over night at Kenosha.”</p>

<p>“They might stand for you that long,”
grinned Victor.</p>

<p>“The question is: can we stand for it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll see you at Milwaukee,” broke
in Charlie. “Too bad, Vic, you’re not going
to stick with us all the way. You’d never
catch me going on any yacht.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I can’t swim.”</p>

<p>“Well, Uncle Ralph wouldn’t expect you
to swim. Anyway, you ought to be ashamed
to admit it.”</p>

<p>“Bet you can’t, either.”</p>

<p>“Your remark is irrelevant, as the lawyers
say,” laughed Victor. “I never yet felt a bit
nervous in the water.”</p>

<p>“Where did you ever paddle about, I’d like
to know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in a tub.”</p>

<p>“Fellows, we’re coming to Lincoln Park,
one of the finest in Chicago,” laughed Charlie.</p>

<p>“Nothing like having your own sightseeing
car,” observed Dave.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“I guess the people around here think they
are seeing sights,” giggled Victor. “With
those glasses on, Somers, you look like the
speed king himself. Just wait till I get my
hands on the throttle—if there’s a mile of
straight road in front I’ll drive her up to
sixty.”</p>

<p>“Huh! This car has to go all the way
to Wisconsin,” sniffed Tom. “We don’t want
to have to telegraph any scrap iron dealer to
hurry out and shovel up the pieces—eh,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Eh, Bob!” repeated Victor, “eh, Bob!
How many times a day do you get that off?
The great chauffeur and his brave passenger,
Clifton! Let Charlie take the helm. He’ll
drive slowly enough to suit you.”</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes gleamed ominously.</p>

<p>“Talking about speed! Why, in Wyoming,
where we didn’t have any old laws to think
about——”</p>

<p>“Oh, why is Wyoming!” chuckled Victor.
“What a state it must be to have no laws.”</p>

<p>“Oh ho, this park is a refreshing sight,”
broke in Dave—“a little oasis in the midst of
mortar, brick and stone. Slow up a bit, Bob,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
so that we may have a better chance to enjoy
the contemplation of nature.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a botany book, Brandon,”
grunted Victor. “See here, Somers!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Never better, thank you. Let me try my
hand at driving?”</p>

<p>Victor’s tone indicated an expectation that
his wishes would be acceded to without objection.
At home he had been so long accustomed
to having his own way that submission
to his imperious demands had come to be expected
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Charlie Blake looked alarmed.</p>

<p>“Going to do it, Bob?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course he’s going to do it,” grinned
Victor, satirically. “Aren’t you, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Not until we get eighty-six miles from
nowhere,” Tom put in.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so, Vic,” answered Bob,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Victor’s expression indicated his displeasure.</p>

<p>“All right then—I’ll let it go now; but
just wait till we get out in the open country,”
he grumbled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“There’s a coolness in the air,” remarked
Tom.</p>

<p>He looked quizzically toward Victor.</p>

<p>“A storm is brewing,” said Dave, absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>Presently the park was left behind. On
and on sped the motor car. There was so
much to see and so little time to see it in
that the brain of each lad held only a confused
impression of many buildings, of trees
and grassy stretches, and shining patches of
lake.</p>

<p>“What place is this we are coming to?”
cried Tom, at length.</p>

<p>“Evanston,” answered Victor.</p>

<p>Some of the citizens were mildly astonished
to see a great touring car containing five lads
whirling through the town.</p>

<p>“Hi, hi! catch on to the joy riders!” yelled
a small boy. “Where’d you get it?”</p>

<p>“No time to answer questions, sonny,”
screeched Victor. “This is the lightning express,
the speediest wagon in the state, with
Somers, the slow-speed wizard, at the throttle.
Whoop-la!”</p>

<p>Evanston was quickly left behind. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
came a succession of small towns along the
lake front. The sky was now almost entirely
overcast. Near the horizon rested a mass of
clouds of a murky, yellowish hue which
seemed to impart to the distant water some of
its own threatening aspect.</p>

<p>At Waukegan the boys stopped for lunch.</p>

<p>A curious look came over Victor Collins’
face as Tom, with an air of much importance,
sprang into the chauffeur’s seat.</p>

<p>“Jehoshaphat! Get out of that!” he exclaimed.
“You’re not going to chauf.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am!” snapped Tom.</p>

<p>“Then it’s my turn next.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know how.”</p>

<p>“What!” scoffed Victor. “Anybody can
do it. How many lessons did it take before
you learned how to blow the horn?”</p>

<p>Tom, uttering a snort of indignation, threw
in the clutch, for by this time the others were
in their places.</p>

<p>The car had traveled over a mile before
Victor spoke again.</p>

<p>“Say, Somers”—his tone was very mild
and sweet—“you’ll let me drive, won’t you—just
a little way?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“A revolution is coming,” murmured
Charlie.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, Victor,” answered Bob.
“It’s too risky.”</p>

<p>“How about Clifton? He hasn’t run into
anything yet.”</p>

<p>“Tom took a course of instruction.”</p>

<p>“Come now, Somers, what are you afraid
of?” Victor’s eyes were snapping. He
leaned over and touched Dave on the shoulder.
“See here, Brandon, say a word for me.
I want to chauf.”</p>

<p>“It is not so written in the book of destiny,”
laughed Dave. “Experience and wisdom
teach us that. Experience is sometimes
necessary before wisdom can be acquired.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bosh!”</p>

<p>Victor brought out the words with angry
emphasis. There was nothing in Dave’s expression
to give him encouragement, and his
eye caught a twitch of amusement on Tom
Clifton’s lips.</p>

<p>It acted upon his impetuous nature somewhat
after the fashion of the spark that explodes
the gasoline vapor.</p>

<p>On the impulse of the moment, he seized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Dave Brandon’s cap and hurled it spitefully
upon the road.</p>

<p>“That’s what you get for sassing me, you
big, fat Indian,” he howled. “Go and pick
it up.”</p>

<p>The stout lad stilled a roar of protest which
began to pour from Tom’s lips.</p>

<p>“Never mind, fellows.” His smiling face
showed no sign of ruffled feelings. “I wanted
a chance to stretch my legs. Thanks, Vic.”</p>

<p>As the motor car came to a halt, he laid
his hand on the door.</p>

<p>Victor Collins looked at him curiously.
Almost on the instant he felt a twinge of regret
at his childish action. He heartily wished
that Dave had flown into a rage. Then, after
a snappy exchange of compliments—at which
pastime he considered himself well able to
hold his own—things might have quieted
down without so much loss to his dignity.</p>

<p>Dave’s unexpected calmness, however, made
him feel uncomfortably small, so he did what
he usually did when things failed to go in a
way that suited him—began to sulk.</p>

<p>Dave “stretched his legs” for a good five
minutes. Then the motor car began to roll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
forward again. Tom didn’t scorch exactly—he
knew that Bob Somers’ watchful eye was
upon him—but several times Charlie Blake’s
nerves received severe jolts, as trees and telegraph
poles by the roadside seemed to be
whirled by with bewildering rapidity.</p>

<p>“Kenosha, Wisconsin, fellows!” exclaimed
Bob, at length, half rising from his seat.</p>

<p>“Kenosha!” echoed all but Victor.</p>

<p>“The first lap of our journey is done!”
cried Dave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>THE “FEARLESS”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the motor car at a garage, the boys
made their way to the harbor. Down by the
river they found a great deal to attract their
attention. Factories with tall chimneys sent
columns of smoke whirling upward; schooners,
barges and a number of smaller craft were
moored along the stream; and these, together
with picturesque buildings, big lumber sheds
or great pilings presented so many pleasing
combinations to the eye that the artistic soul
of Dave was enraptured.</p>

<p>The smell of fresh water was in the air, and
along with it came a faint odor of things
belonging to shipping. The gurgle and splash
of lapping waves and the creaking of boats
vainly tugging at their moorings formed a
steady accompaniment to the occasional puffing
of passing tugs or the hoarse blasts of
whistles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Close alongside a big lumber schooner the
boys, who had taken turns in carrying Victor’s
heavy luggage, finally discovered the motor
yacht “Fearless.”</p>

<p>A big, burly man busy at some work on the
wharf looked up as they approached.</p>

<p>Captain Ralph Bunderley had been successively
the master of a barge, a coastwise
schooner and a windjammer on the Atlantic.
Having been left a comfortable fortune by a
relative, he finally retired from the sea, but,
feeling that to get away from the sight of land
occasionally was as necessary to him as water
to a fish, he had built a motor yacht some
sixty feet in length designed for speed, as well
as to withstand the rough weather on the lake.</p>

<p>Victor, still in a surly mood, felt considerably
embarrassed, for Uncle Ralph, attired in
a suit of faded blue overalls and a greasy cap,
gave more the impression of being a man out
of a job than one of the richest citizens in the
community.</p>

<p>The boy glanced slyly around to see if any
of his companions were wearing suspicious
grins, but, to his relief, they were too busily
engaged in inspecting the graceful lines of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
motor yacht to pay attention to the captain’s
appearance.</p>

<p>Uncle Ralph cordially shook hands. His
bluff, hearty way caught the fancy of the
crowd, and before long they were talking
together like old acquaintances.</p>

<p>“There is certainly a lot of class to that
cruiser, captain!” exclaimed Tom, in his gruff
tones, “and I’ll bet it can go some, too.”</p>

<p>“Over twenty miles an hour,” answered
Uncle Ralph, smilingly. “We’ll go aboard
now.” He raised his voice. “Hey, you Phil
Malone!”</p>

<p>Like a jack-in-the-box, a face popped
quickly to one of the cabin port-holes.</p>

<p>“That’s Phil,” explained the captain. “My
first mate, I call him—a bashful young chap,
especially among strangers. Consider yourselves
introduced.”</p>

<p>The boys heard a few mumbling words.
Then the face disappeared.</p>

<p>The “Fearless,” a raised deck cruiser with a
rakish bow, painted a creamy white, and
relieved here and there by touches of blue and
gold, made a striking appearance against the
background of restless water. Like a racer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
impatient for the start she strained and tugged
at her cables, occasionally rolling slightly as
heavier onslaughts of choppy waves gurgled
and splashed against her hull.</p>

<p>Before the crowd could set foot on deck Phil
Malone appeared. He was tall and angular,
with red hair, a long, gaunt face and deep-set
eyes. He looked at his visitors with such
a comical expression of astonishment that
Victor, forgetting his ill-humor for the moment,
burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“You never expected to see a bunch of
Indians like this, hey, Phil?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Naw—I—I sure didn’t,” agreed Phil, as
he diffidently backed away.</p>

<p>“Here now, don’t you run off. Give us a
song.”</p>

<p>“Let Phil alone,” commanded Uncle Ralph.
“Singing isn’t his forte. He’s better at polishing
brass.”</p>

<p>“Clifton has an awful lot that needs attention,”
mumbled Victor.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, fellows, this isn’t seeing the
yacht,” broke in Bob.</p>

<p>“Let the inspection begin at once,” returned
Captain Bunderley, with a smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>They followed him to the companionway
and then down into the dining saloon.</p>

<p>Standing in the cozy interior the boys with
the exception of Victor voiced their enthusiasm
in words that brought forth chuckles of
satisfaction from the old salt’s lips.</p>

<p>Never did woodwork, or door-knobs, or furnishings
appear more spotlessly clean than
those revealed by the cold gray rays streaming
through the open port-holes.</p>

<p>“These,” remarked Captain Bunderley—he
indicated the ports—“are provided with heavy
plate glass and can be so locked as to make
them practically water-tight. With ordinary
windows, after a heavy sea has been pounding
against the boat for several hours, the cabin
would probably be in a mess.” Walking
across the floor, he opened a door. “Let me
introduce you to the engine room and galley.”</p>

<p>“Phil’s the galley-slave,” confided Victor,
in a loud whisper.</p>

<p>“Who’s the engineer, captain?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Jack Stubbs, a sailor I had with me on
many a sea voyage. Martin Ricks is the
helmsman.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“Now, uncle, please show the bunch your
stateroom,” put in Victor.</p>

<p>The captain led them to a passageway
abaft the engine room, presently stepping
into a compartment finished in enamel
white.</p>

<p>“This is enough to make even me feel like
becoming a skipper,” commented Dave.</p>

<p>“If only it weren’t so dreadfully dangerous,”
ventured Charlie Blake.</p>

<p>“Certainly would be with him as skipper,”
piped Victor.</p>

<p>Out in the open air again the crowd found
an awning extending from the stern to a point
where the raised deck began. Dave expressed
the opinion that it must be very delightful to
sit there on a pleasant day, with the water
sparkling in the sunlight and a gentle breeze
sighing past.</p>

<p>“I guess some howling blasts would make
you the sigher, instead,” laughed Victor.</p>

<p>“Say, Bob!”</p>

<p>Tom Clifton’s voice cut sharply into the
conversation.</p>

<p>“Let’s hear it, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about that ball nine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of ours. Kirk Talbot had an awful nerve
to——”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” grinned Victor. “Can’t you
get that off your mind, Clifton?”</p>

<p>Tom tossed his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” he snapped. “Besides,
I’ve got an idea, and a mighty good one. I’ll
tell you all about it to-night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry yourself. We can wait.”
Victor nudged Charlie sharply in the ribs.
“Say, Blakelets, don’t you wish you were
going along with us on the ‘Fearless’ to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Charlie was one of those lads who possess
a certain ill-defined dread of the water. At
almost every roll of the deck rather shivery
feelings coursed along his spine.</p>

<p>“Gracious! I don’t see why in the world
Victor wants to go to Milwaukee by boat,” he
thought, nervously. He took a long, earnest
look at the sky, then exclaimed, with considerable
emphasis:</p>

<p>“No, Vic, I most certainly do not!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>THE CIRCUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Ramblers and Charlie Blake secured
quarters at one of Kenosha’s principal hotels.
As Captain Bunderley had some business to
attend to, Victor decided to remain with them
until the hour for turning in.</p>

<p>Immediately after supper the crowd gathered
in Bob Somers’ room.</p>

<p>Dave Brandon, the poet and historian of
the club, was soon reclining with his accustomed
ease at the window. The dark, gloomy
night strangely stirred his imagination.
Vague inspirations floated through his brain.
He thought of the lonely lake as the subject
for a poem; he cudgeled his brain to seize
and hold fast the elusive words which constantly
flitted before his mental vision.</p>

<p>Presently Dave sat up. A walk in the open
air, he decided, might aid him in cornering
this near-inspiration.</p>

<p>Bob Somers was busy writing a letter; Victor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and Charlie were talking, while Tom at a
table all by himself kept scribbling on sheet
after sheet of paper. Tom’s face wore a tremendous
frown, as though his work were of a deep
and absorbing nature.</p>

<p>“Hello! Owing to the increased demand
for paper the price must soon advance,”
chirped Victor, suddenly. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>“You mean what’s going down,” laughed
Blake.</p>

<p>Tom seemed to hesitate. He glanced sternly
toward Victor, then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“This is what I was going to tell you about.
I’m getting up a set of by-laws for our new
Athletic Association.”</p>

<p>The room was immediately in an uproar.
Dave, fearful that all his ideas might vanish,
jumped up hastily and walked to the
door.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back soon, Bob!” he called, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Out in the corridor, Tom’s voice, already
raised in a hot argument with Victor, still
reached him. In another moment he was
down-stairs and on the street.</p>

<p>A brisk walk in the cool air promised to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
aid Dave’s faculties, as he had hoped. Already
the vague phrases in his mind were beginning
to shape themselves into definite
words.</p>

<p>Here and there a swinging sign-board
mingled a series of dismal creaking notes
with the crisp moaning of a gusty breeze.
Autumn leaves, ruthlessly torn from their
resting places on the branches, occasionally
whirled helter-skelter through the air, to
dance merrily along the streets. Trails of
dust, banging shutters, or flickering lights
were all tributes to the tyranny of the never-ceasing
currents.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, in a sheltered position
near an electric light, Dave was writing
stanzas at record speed. It was really delightful—the
way in which that near-inspiration
had been finally conquered.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice broke in upon him.</p>

<p>“Say, Brandon, owing to the unprecedented
demand for paper in Kenosha the mills will
be compelled to work overtime.”</p>

<p>Dave turned abruptly. Victor Collins’
dapper little figure was standing close beside
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Gracious; you here!” cried the writer, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“No; I’m back there, still kidding the
by-law committee,” chuckled Victor. “Seriously,
though, I finished him in about half a
minute and skipped after you. What have
you got there?”</p>

<p>“Almost a poem,” confessed Dave.</p>

<p>“Read it,” commanded Victor, imperiously.</p>

<p>“Never!” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>Victor argued and coaxed. He even prepared
to land a “good one” in the neighborhood
of the ribs; his little fists, tightly
clenched, gyrated fiercely. But Dave’s clever
footwork more than balanced Victor’s speed.</p>

<p>“All right, smarty,” grumbled the boy.
“Bet it’s awful piffle, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Come along, Vic,” laughed Dave, as he
started off.</p>

<p>Victor Collins’ wishes were not often so disregarded
as they had been during that day.
It touched his pride.</p>

<p>“If I don’t find a way to make these fine
chaps drop down a peg or two before to-morrow
I’ll be much surprised,” he muttered
grimly to himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Thereupon Victor set his thoughts briskly
to work in an effort to find a scheme for getting
square.</p>

<p>Down one street, or out another, the two
wandered, often in silence, for each had many
thoughts to engage his attention, though
on widely divergent subjects. The busier,
brightly-lighted sections began to be slowly
left behind. Electric cars no longer whizzed
past them.</p>

<p>Dave and Victor finally found themselves
on a wide, tree-lined avenue.</p>

<p>“What a delightful retreat,” murmured
Dave. “Sitting on a nice, comfortable porch
I could get ideas for a dozen—eh?”</p>

<p>Victor had clutched his arm.</p>

<p>“Say, look straight ahead, Brandon!” he
cried.</p>

<p>“I declare, I see lights, and more lights!”
exclaimed Dave.</p>

<p>The pair began to stare earnestly toward a
number of starlike points which were moving
about in a most erratic fashion.</p>

<p>“What in the mischief are they?” asked
Victor. “Think some of the stars have tumbled
poetically down through the clouds?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Give it up,” laughed Dave. “We’ll know
before the night is over.”</p>

<p>Victor, whose curiosity was highly excited,
now easily kept ahead of his taller companion.
But the lights had entirely disappeared, leaving
the street to end apparently in a void of
blackness.</p>

<p>“Looks like a jumping off place,” exclaimed
Victor. “Hurry up, Brandon.”</p>

<p>They began to walk rapidly, soon covering
a number of blocks.</p>

<p>Suddenly the cluster of lights flashed into
view once more. Five minutes later they
heard a series of dull thuds, as of hammering,
accompanied at intervals by a low rumbling
of wagon wheels. When an open lot which
faced the street was reached Dave and his
companion saw a number of flaming torches
that sent weird streaks of yellow over the
ground, lighting up in their course groups
of men busily engaged with sledge-hammers.</p>

<p>Dave Brandon’s eyes were instantly attracted
toward a huge bill-board which rose
from amidst a tangle of weeds and grasses.
The rays from a gas lamp cast a flickering
glow over its multi-colored surface.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“Look, Vic,” he exclaimed, with a laugh.
“The mystery is solved.”</p>

<p>And Victor, whose eyes were bright with
interest, read in letters that almost took in
the entire length of the board:</p>

<p>“Ollie Spudger’s Great Combined Peerless
Circus and Menagerie.”</p>

<p>“By George—a circus! Isn’t this jolly
good luck, Brandon?” he cried, enthusiastically.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>GEORGY, THE GIANT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Victor Collins</span> had not yet arrived at an
age when a circus loses its power to thrill the
heart with joy. Each gilded chariot, each
gaudy menagerie wagon or gorgeous trapping
still awoke within his breast a responsive
chord.</p>

<p>“They’re driving in stakes, Brandon,” he
exclaimed. “See—there’s a wagon—a four-horser,
and lots of others back. We’re just
in time to watch ’em put up the tent.”</p>

<p>Over on the lot an odor of rank weeds and
grasses filled the air. It was all very black
and forbidding, unpleasantly suggestive of
treacherous pitfalls or deep, stagnant pools
of water, save where the rays of flaring light
streamed through the gloom.</p>

<p>Heavy wagons drawn by four horses rumbled
their way across the bumpy, uneven field,
occasionally becoming stuck in the yielding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
turf, whereupon the yells of drivers and cracking
of whips came sharply to their ears.</p>

<p>“Working like the dickens, aren’t they?”
remarked Victor. “Let’s skip around a bit.”</p>

<p>The two, steering a course around various
obstructions, made their way toward the busy
scene. Soon they caught a glimpse of a faint
grayish mass of canvas spread out over the
ground, while towering aloft like the masts
of a ship were a number of poles.</p>

<p>“That’s the big top, or main tent,” said
Dave.</p>

<p>“Heads up there—look out!”</p>

<p>Above the sound of the jolting and creaking
of a big red wagon and crisp jingle of
harness came the deep-throated warning. The
leaders of a four-horse team swerved sharply
around.</p>

<p>“Over here, you for the flying squadron,”
some one hailed from the distance.</p>

<p>“Flying squadron! What in thunder is
that?” cried Victor, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“The commissary department,” answered
Dave. “In all well-regulated shows that is
attended to first. Guess this wagon is full of
stuff they’ll need in a hurry for the mess tent.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>A straggling procession, mainly of boys,
soon began to arrive; the lonely, dismal lot
was fast becoming transformed into a scene
of great bustle and activity. More torches
were flaring, and the echoing thuds of the
sledges increased in force and number. A
bright glare from a calcium light soon
streamed over the field.</p>

<p>A force of workers with pick and shovel
were leveling the ground, while still others
spread thick layers of straw over tracts where
recent rains had formed puddles of considerable
size.</p>

<p>Presently a murmuring chorus from the
crowds of excited children burst into a loud
hubbub of joyous shouts.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” laughed Victor, attracted by
the commotion.</p>

<p>Some distance ahead, amid the wagons, a
huge form was looming up, now dim and
scarcely seen in the gloom, then brought
sharply into relief by the flaring lights.</p>

<p>“Hurray, here’s the elephant, as I live,”
shouted Victor. “Gee, Brandon—what was
that? Didn’t you hear something?”</p>

<p>The boys were threading a dark, gloomy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
passage between two great wagons, now horseless,
their tarpaulin-covered tops seeming to
tower to a great height above them. A
strange sound, suggestive of a deep sigh, had
cut into Victor’s sentence, and when it came a
second time the two looked about them with
interest.</p>

<p>They saw several bales of hay, showing
dimly against the field, another deserted
wagon, and an indistinct figure.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Victor.</p>

<p>As he spoke the form began to rise, and, to
their utter astonishment, continued to rise
until it stood high above the bales, and so
high that both uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” breathed Victor. “Why—why——”</p>

<p>“Say, who are you?”</p>

<p>A shrill childish treble came from the towering
figure, which immediately began to move
around the barricade of bales toward them.
The boys watched him with breathless interest.</p>

<p>“Say, who are you?”</p>

<p>They craned their necks to look up at the
face that gazed into theirs, but the obscurity
was so great that neither could determine the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
age, the character, or the appearance of the
singularly tall being whose voice resembled
that of a fourteen-year-old boy.</p>

<p>“I say—what’s the matter? Who are you,
anyway?”</p>

<p>The third inquiry came in petulant, piping
tones.</p>

<p>“If we could find a step-ladder,” began
Victor, struggling unsuccessfully to repress
his mirth, “it——”</p>

<p>“That’s always the way. I’m the most
miserable chap in the whole world.”</p>

<p>Victor lighted a match, and, shielding the
fluttering flame in the hollow of his hand,
deliberately directed the rays into the face of
the giant. They saw a small, well-shaped and
extremely boyish head crowned with dark
brown hair.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I hope you are satisfied.”
The shrill treble held a note of resignation.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious! How old are you?”
demanded Victor.</p>

<p>“Fifteen. And I’m the most miserable
chap in the——”</p>

<p>“Why—what’s the matter?” inquired
Dave.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“You’d better ask me what isn’t the
matter,” answered the young giant, with a
long, deep sigh. “Come on—sit down. I
do so want to talk to somebody before Peter
Whiffin gets here.”</p>

<p>“Peter Whiffin! Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“General manager of Ollie Spudger’s Great
Combined Peerless Circus and Menagerie.
He doesn’t allow me to talk to people. You
see”—the giant, leading the way, paused
until he had settled himself on a bale of hay,
where, after a great deal of difficulty, he managed
to dispose of his long legs in a comfortable
fashion—“well, it’s this way,” he went
on, dolefully: “Peter Whiffin doesn’t believe
in giving anything for nothing. I belong to
the show—see? People must pay to look at
the giant; so I’m smuggled around in the
dark. It’s awful. Mustn’t talk to strangers;
mustn’t do this, or that. An’ when anybody
does see me outside the tents I’m followed an’
stared at, an’ made fun of. Oh, but I’m so
sick of it! An’, do you know——”</p>

<p>The young giant’s wailing notes ceased, and
he peered eagerly around.</p>

<p>“Well?” questioned Dave.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“I’m still growing.”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious!”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s a fact—an’ most seven feet now.”
The giant seemed almost on the verge of
blubbering. Then, with an effort, he controlled
his voice. “But say, who are you?”</p>

<p>“One member of the Rambler Club, and
one near-member,” grinned Victor.</p>

<p>“There it goes again—always the same;
every one has to guy me. Oh, I’m the most
miserable chap in the whole——”</p>

<p>“Avast there, my hearty!” laughed Dave.
“I’ll explain.” And he did, while the giant
listened with rapt attention.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could only do something like
that, too,” he murmured, when Dave had concluded.
“What a dandy lot of fun you
fellows are going to have. But it’s no use!”</p>

<p>“Hey, Georgy—oh, Georgy! Where in
thunder are you?”</p>

<p>“There’s Peter Whiffin.” The giant raised
his voice. “Over here, Mr. Whiffin.”</p>

<p>The circus manager, scarcely seen in the
gloom, and coming from the direction of the
lights, increased his pace, scrambling around
obstructions, and giving vent to his displeasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
at the weeds and inequality of the ground by
emphatic exclamations.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s all this?”</p>

<p>Peter Whiffin had a querulous voice and a
manner which went singularly well with it.
He was a small man, and Victor’s method of
throwing light on the subject by means of a
match immediately disclosed sharp features, a
pair of shifting gray eyes, a face lined with
hollows and wrinkles, and a yellow moustache
which drooped despondently at the corners.</p>

<p>“Well, blow me—if you ain’t ’bout the
coolest I ever see!” exclaimed Peter Whiffin,
when the fluttering flame had vanished.
“You’ve got your nerve with you, hey?”</p>

<p>“Always carry plenty of it in stock,” said
Victor, calmly.</p>

<p>“See here, Georgy, didn’t I tell you not to
gab with every stranger that comes along?”</p>

<p>“I have to talk to some one, Mr. Whiffin;
I’m so miserable.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! Says he is miserable! Did
you ever hear the like o’ it!” The manager’s
tones bespoke the deepest disgust. “Why,
ain’t he makin’ more money in a week than
most people in a month? Well, well!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>Mr. Peter Whiffin’s emotions seemed to rise
to such a point as to almost choke his utterances.
He strode to and fro for a moment,
then exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to fetch you one right in
the ribs. It’s ingratitood—it’s worse. An’
his pap a-gittin’ paid every week as reg’lar as
the clock ticks! I’ll plunk you for that, I
will.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to get plunked,” wailed
the giant, with a catch in his voice.</p>

<p>“Well, then, don’t git off no more sich
nonsense. Miserable, indeed! That ’ud be
somethink for your pap to hear ’bout, eh?
Ain’t there no thanks in that nature o’
yourn?”</p>

<p>“What have I to be thankful for, Mr.
Whiffin? If I was only like these boys here
I’d give anything in the world.”</p>

<p>Peter Whiffin snorted with indignation.
He did more. Seizing the giant roughly by
the arm, he commanded him to move, and
move fast, under penalty of receiving an
assorted number of hooks, straight lefts, and
right uppercuts, and accompanied his remarks
with an exhibition of these same blows, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
coming perilously near the person of the complaining
giant.</p>

<p>“If this here chatter ain’t a bit more’n the
limit,” he growled. “An’ me not knowin’
what I’m a-goin’ to do for a barker to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Jack Gray?”
asked George, forgetting his troubles for an
instant.</p>

<p>“He’s went an’ took sich a cold that his
voice sounds like a frog croakin’; that’s what’s
the matter. If I ain’t in a mess for a spieler
my name ain’t Whiffin. I can’t do it meself;
an’ there ain’t nobody worth shucks in the
hull shootin’ match.”</p>

<p>The voice of the unhappy manager gradually
grew faint in the distance, then, presently,
became lost altogether amidst the medley of
noises that arose on all sides.</p>

<p>“Say, Brandon, think of that poor little
giant standing for all of Peter Whiffin’s fresh
talk,” said Victor, disgustedly. “Why, if he’d
just start falling——”</p>

<p>“And if Peter got caught beneath him it
would make a mighty sad story,” grinned
Dave.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>The two walked out beyond the grim
shadows of the wagons, directing their course
toward the light and activity beyond. Already
the canvas of the “big top” was looming high
in the air, a dim, shapeless patch of ghostly
white. The rumble of vehicles had given
place to the clink and rattle of harness, as
teams were unhitched and driven across the
lots.</p>

<p>A crowd of shouting children surrounded
three elephants, while others flocked around
closed cages, uttering comments which revealed
their curiosity regarding the strange
and savage inmates. Boys carrying buckets
of water passed and repassed, straining their
little arms to an alarming extent, but feeling
sure that they were having the time of their
lives.</p>

<p>Dave and his companion soon found themselves
in the thick of the fray watching a pair
of sturdy horses hitched to the end of a long
rope which led to a block and tackle.</p>

<p>Crack! The driver’s whip echoed sharply.
Away they went. The center of the big top
was drawn slowly up to its highest point on
the middle pole, and, within a short time, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
limp canvas began to straighten and assume
the form of a circus tent.</p>

<p>“Jolly well done, that,” commented Dave.
“Spudger’s Great Combined Peerless Circus
and Menagerie looks like a winner to me.
And the mess tent is all up, too.”</p>

<p>They moved off toward it, each occasionally
halted by piles of rubbish. Twice Victor put
his foot into an unseen hole, then cracked his
shin against a piece of board.</p>

<p>“Makes a pleasant variety, doesn’t it?” said
Dave, as he heard his companion’s howl of
disapproval.</p>

<p>“Pleasant?” snapped Victor. “It’s a wonder
something hasn’t risen up off the ground
and broken my legs. Are we about to fall
into the town ash-pit, or what?”</p>

<p>“We may escape such a fate as that.”</p>

<p>Victor laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, Brandon,” he said, “if it hadn’t
been for your encouragement to the paper industry
my ankle wouldn’t be aching like the
dickens.”</p>

<p>“Or we shouldn’t have seen the circus,
either,” returned Dave, “which shows that
some good has come from my poems, after all.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>At the mess tent they found preparations
for feeding the workers going on briskly. But
their attention became speedily attracted
toward several tents in which the horses were
being stabled.</p>

<p>“Makes me think of Wyoming and old
broncho days,” went on Dave, softly. “Guess
I won’t do any more riding, though, for a
mighty long time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fade away with such boasting,” said
Victor. “Nothing could make me believe
that you ever rode a broncho.”</p>

<p>“Why, I——”</p>

<p>Dave didn’t get far with his protest.</p>

<p>“Fade!” roared Victor. And the stout
boy concluded to abide by the command.</p>

<p>It was not until half an hour later that the
two turned away from the noise and chaotic
confusion in which Spudger’s Great Combined
Peerless Circus and Menagerie was still involved.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind seeing the show,” remarked
Victor, “but at ten o’clock sharp to-morrow
morning Uncle Ralph’s yacht pulls
out.”</p>

<p>“And our motor car will leave about two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>,” said Dave. “So, unless something
happens mighty soon, the adventures of the
Rambler Club in this part of the country will
add only a few dozen pages to my history.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>JOE RODGERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> on the following morning the crowd
was sitting in Bob Somers’ room at the hotel.
Tom Clifton, at first just mildly vexed, threatened
to become real angry. Victor’s saucy
face and ready tongue promised, before very
long, to call down upon his head a storm of
wrath from the future physician.</p>

<p>“I tell you these by-laws and Bob Somers’
ball nine will make a fine stir among the
chaps at the Kingswood High,” he snapped,
sternly.</p>

<p>“Read your old by-laws,” challenged Victor,
with an aggravating grin.</p>

<p>“I’ll not read ’em,” Tom flung back in icy
tones.</p>

<p>“It’s all a pipe dream. Don’t believe the
club will ever be formed, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t!”</p>

<p>“All right—I won’t!”</p>

<p>“But I’ll bet that before you’re three-sixteenths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of an inch taller, just the same, we’ll
have played half a dozen games.”</p>

<p>“Oh my, oh my! Is that so?” jeered Victor.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is so!”</p>

<p>“Come, come, boys,” interposed Dave,
smilingly. “No joking, now. Remember to-day
is the day when our paths will be separated
by a waste of water.”</p>

<p>“A little of it sprinkled on that flowery
remark wouldn’t be wasted,” chirruped Victor.
“See here, Clifton!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Going out with us now?”</p>

<p>“No! I haven’t finished yet. You chaps
skip along. But don’t forget to come back in
time.”</p>

<p>Victor was ready with a parting shot.</p>

<p>“Just suppose I should shanghai the whole
bunch on board the ‘Fearless’ and take ’em
clean to Milwaukee?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I’d expect them to go, unless
they got all smeared up with cylinder
oil,” growled Tom.</p>

<p>“Listen to the smart Aleck! I mean,
wouldn’t you be some scared?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Hey?” Tom’s usually gruff voice took on
an odd note of shrillness. “Hey?” he repeated,
with a rising inflection. “Scared of
what?”</p>

<p>“Why, to take that big car out alone.”</p>

<p>Tom’s forbearance was not proof against
such insinuations.</p>

<p>“Well, I should rather say not!” he exclaimed,
hotly. “I’d drive from Kenosha to
Kingswood without the quiver of an eye.”</p>

<p>“Hear—hear!—A new way to propel a
motor car just discovered by Chauffeur Clifton:
no clutch; no gasoline required; ‘without
the quiver of an eye’ runs a car three hundred
miles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re mighty brilliant,” snapped
Tom.</p>

<p>“Then don’t try to light on me. Are you
going to be a flopper, Clifton?”</p>

<p>“A flopper! What in the mischief is that?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s just like this——” Victor
grinned in his most irritating fashion. “If
the boys shouldn’t happen to turn up you’ll
know they’ve gone to Milwaukee with me—see?
Now, to flop would mean that——”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t the nerve to take a flyer alone, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
suppose?” supplemented Tom. For an instant
he scowled almost savagely. Then,
catching a wink from Dave Brandon, the
expression of his face suddenly softened. He
gave a quiet laugh. “Can’t string me, lad;
oh no!”</p>

<p>An approving nod from the historian rewarded
this remark.</p>

<p>“Hope it doesn’t rain,” observed Bob, carelessly.</p>

<p>The boys glanced through the window-panes
at an even gray expanse of cloud against
which the opposite buildings cut sharply.</p>

<p>“Looks mighty threatening,” admitted
Dave. “Isn’t any worse than yesterday,
though.”</p>

<p>“Come ahead, fellows. We’ll start out,
anyway,” cried Bob. “So-long, Tom. Good
luck!”</p>

<p>“Say, you Indians, he’s the easiest chap to
jolly I ever came across.”</p>

<p>Victor opened the conversation in this
agreeable style the moment the four had
stepped into the street.</p>

<p>“You’d better leave Tom alone,” cautioned
Bob.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“He might take the law into his own
hands,” drawled Dave. He smiled whimsically.
“When Tom gets started——”</p>

<p>“It must be something awful,” finished
Victor, with a gurgle of mirth.</p>

<p>“Clifton’s a mighty fine chap, Vic,” declared
Charlie, reprovingly. “Wait till you
know him a bit better. Where away, Bob?”</p>

<p>“It’s Spudger’s Great Combined Peerless
Circus and Menagerie for me.” Victor spoke
in tones which admitted of no argument. He
poked Dave playfully in the ribs. “How
about it, Brownie?”</p>

<p>The historian grinned complacently.</p>

<p>“I’m willing. What do you say, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wanted to take another look at
Captain Bunderley’s yacht,” answered Bob,
slowly. “Still——”</p>

<p>“Run along, then,” grinned Victor. “Brandon’s
on my side. Where do you stand, Blakelets?
Don’t hesitate. He who hesitates is
lost.”</p>

<p>“No one ever could be in a nice little place
like Kenosha,” said Charlie, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“Very good—that is for you. Which is it—circus
or boat?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>The “grind” had long since outgrown such
amusements as the circus. Thoughts of the
sawdust arena conjured up before his mental
vision nothing but frivolity and foolishness,
so a prompt, “I’m with Bob, Vic,” answered
the query of the lawyer’s son.</p>

<p>“My name isn’t Bob Vic,” smiled Victor.</p>

<p>The smile presently grew into a laugh of
such proportions that he began to slap his
knees in the paroxysm of mirth.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Bob, somewhat astonished.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, what is the matter
now?” asked Charlie. “You’re the funniest
chap I ever saw. Cut it out. People are
looking.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em look,” gurgled Victor. “Something
rich just struck me. Ha, ha! Maybe
Brandon could get a job as clown. Ha, ha!
Wouldn’t that round face of his look swell
touched up with a little powder and paint,
eh? He could read some of those famous
poems, too!”</p>

<p>“I’ll give the matter careful consideration,”
said Dave, good-naturedly. “And you might
try for the position of animal tamer.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“I’m an Indian tamer, now,” piped Victor.
He seized Dave’s arm, jerking him around.
“You and I are going this way, Brownie.
So-long, Boblets. In about an hour we’ll
meet you and Blakelets at the wharf.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Bob. “I guess you’ll
find us swapping land tales for the sea tales of
Captain Bunderley. So-long.”</p>

<p>Victor’s delicate fingers closed tightly
around Dave’s wrist.</p>

<p>“Come ahead fast,” he ordered, imperiously.
“Must be an awful lot to see around that show.”</p>

<p>In a short time the two turned a corner
where they came in sight, far ahead, of a
group of dull gray tents and tarpaulin-covered
wagons.</p>

<p>On the lot the two boys found, despite the
early hour, a scene of great activity. Stock
was being watered or fed, while performers
and other employees crowded the men’s tent.
Huge wagons cast blurred shadows over the
ground. One lone chariot, left outside to
whet the appetite of the curious, stood before
the main entrance. Its gilt ornamentation,
of wondrous curves and twists, framed a
painting in which the artist had allowed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
fervid imagination full sway. A hunter, in
the African wilds, lay in the midst of tall,
tangled grass with the paws of a gigantic lion
planted on his breast. The animal’s mouth,
astonishingly wide open, revealed a row of
glistening teeth.</p>

<p>“That artist was certainly great on the
dental work,” pronounced Victor.</p>

<p>To another school of art, according to Dave,
belonged several huge canvases which flanked
the main entrance. These were painted with
a bolder, broader touch, and represented
“Adolphus,” the world-renowned boy giant,
“Zingar,” the celebrated dwarf, “Monsieur Ormond
de Sylveste,” wizard of bareback riders,
in his speed-defying and world-stupefying exhibition,
“Tobanus,” the apparently jointless
wonder, a contortionist and sword swallower,
and, lastly, “Colossus,” “Titan,” and “Nero,”
the three great African elephants whose stupendous
feats had amazed the whole civilized
world.</p>

<p>“Some show, this,” laughed Victor, his eyes
roaming over the scene with great interest.</p>

<p>They crossed the lot, peeped into the mess
tent, then wandered from place to place, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
walking in the shadow of monster
wagons or long trucks whose heavy wheels
were often sunk deep in the turf.</p>

<p>“Looks as if Spudger’s was here for life,”
commented Victor.</p>

<p>“And yet the circus will probably leave
to-night,” said Dave. “A strenuous life,
indeed—positively makes me weary even to
think of it. Oh ho! Come on, Vic.”</p>

<p>A nice, comfortable-looking stump a few
yards away had attracted the historian’s attention.
Its call was altogether too strong to be
resisted. Unheeding the loud expostulations
of Victor, he walked over, and, with a sigh of
satisfaction, seated himself upon it.</p>

<p>“A fine place to get a good perspective of
the show, Vic,” he exclaimed. “I’d like to
make a sketch.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be done while I’m here,” said
Victor, in positive tones; “unless,” he added,
mischievously, “you can work while your
neck is being tickled with a blade of grass.”</p>

<p>“Tyrant!” laughed Dave. He raised his
finger warningly. “I give notice, however:
no power can budge me for at least five
minutes.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>Victor looked displeased.</p>

<p>“That’s a challenge. We’ll see about it,”
he snapped.</p>

<p>The lad immediately made an attempt to
convince Dave that his opinion on the subject
was an entirely mistaken one. But all his
pushing and tugging merely resulted in Victor
making himself quite hot and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>It annoyed him very much indeed.</p>

<p>A second and more strenuous effort to dislodge
the stout boy brought forth a mild
protest.</p>

<p>“Quit it!” commanded Dave.</p>

<p>“Humph; I don’t have to!”</p>

<p>The next instant Victor found his wrists
being held in a grip of steel.</p>

<p>“Let go, Brandon; let go!” he stormed.
“I’ll punch your head if you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Promise to stop, Vic?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ll promise nothing, you big Indian,
you large spot in the landscape! Let go!”</p>

<p>“Only when I have your word, Vic.”</p>

<p>Victor struggled furiously to free himself.</p>

<p>“How dare you grab me like that, Brandon?”
he howled. “Ouch! It hurts like
fun. Gee, if I don’t get square with you for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
this I never saw a senator—and my father’s
best friend’s a senator!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Jumbo, what’s up?”</p>

<p>This salutation, uttered in very loud tones,
put a stop to further hostilities.</p>

<p>Both instantly turned.</p>

<p>A lad—and a very odd-looking lad indeed—had
just stepped from behind a wagon and
was surveying them with a curious mixture
of amusement and surprise. He appeared to
be about fifteen years of age. His round,
chubby face was liberally besprinkled with
freckles; a mop of thick yellowish hair, supporting
a dilapidated cap, straggled across a
broad forehead, the wind occasionally blowing
it in his eyes.</p>

<p>Dave found it difficult to repress a laugh.</p>

<p>“Looks like a real little character,” he said,
softly, to himself.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jumbo, what’s up?” repeated the boy.</p>

<p>He shuffled forward, his movements being
somewhat impeded by a huge bucket of water
in one hand and a broom in the other.</p>

<p>“Say—if ye’re abusin’ that little kid I won’t
stan’ for it. Do you get me?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Victor, already angry, bristled up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Why, we were only fooling, you silly
duffer,” he retorted; “and——”</p>

<p>“Good-morning!” put in Dave, politely.</p>

<p>“Mornin’! Weren’t no scrap, then? Say,
Jumbo, you’re too late; Whiffin’s hired a fat
man a’ready. You lookin’ for a job, Buster?”</p>

<p>Victor swelled up with hot indignation. To
be addressed in such slighting terms by a boy
whose rough attire and general appearance
indicated a very low status in society was
more than his nature could stand.</p>

<p>“Get away from here, boy,” he snapped.
“We didn’t say anything to you.”</p>

<p>The freckle-faced lad’s mouth flew open.
He set down broom and bucket.</p>

<p>“Well, by gum, I said somethin’ to you.”</p>

<p>“And you needn’t say any more. Go on
about your business.”</p>

<p>“If yer wasn’t so small I’d fetch you a clip
for that.”</p>

<p>Victor’s anger rose to the boiling point.</p>

<p>“Chase him away, you Indian!” he shouted
to Dave. “See here, Freckles, my father is
one of the biggest lawyers in Chicago.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t keer if he owned a whole sideshow,
an’——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p070.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“ARE YOU WORKING FOR THE CIRCUS?”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” interposed Dave. “This
won’t do.” A touch of authority in his tone
stopped a hot reply from Victor. “Are you
working for the circus?—Yes? Well, what is
your name?”</p>

<p>“Me name is Mister Joe Rodgers.”</p>

<p>This answer, accompanied by an expansive
grin and a wink, to Victor’s utter astonishment
and disgust, brought forth a low chuckling
laugh from the stout boy.</p>

<p>“Come on, Brandon,” urged Victor, stiffly.
“You’re keeping the water-carrier from his
job.”</p>

<p>“Say, ain’t them clothes o’ hisn somethin’
fine? Bet he never did a lick o’ real work in
his life. D’ye know what a pay envelope
looks like, bub?”</p>

<p>Victor brandished his small white fists furiously
and dashed in front of the circus boy.
But Dave, quickly springing between the two,
prevented actual hostilities.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Victor,” he said, sternly.</p>

<p>“Get away, you big lump!” howled young
Collins. “Take his part—that’s right. You’ve
got a yellow streak a yard wide.”</p>

<p>“By gum, him an’ Peter Whiffin ’ud make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
a fine pair this mornin’,” exclaimed “Mister
Joe Rodgers,” with a long, critical stare at the
lawyer’s son. “Ha, ha! Whiffin can’t find
no barker; he’s up ag’in it bad. Him an’
him”—he indicated Victor—“is sure like cats
that’s had their tails trod on hard. I’d like
to cool ’em off with this bucket o’ water. I’m
a purty good feller, I am; I ain’t a bit perwerse.
But don’t nobody rile me.”</p>

<p>“All of which relieves our minds,” remarked
Dave, gravely. “Hold on, Vic!”</p>

<p>Victor, however, thoroughly disgusted, had
no intention of waiting. Only a week before
the hand of a senator had patted him on the
shoulder in a fatherly way—and now! Well—“Mister
Joe Rodgers” evidently didn’t
know to whom he was talking. It was outrageous;
and, what was more, Dave had calmly
permitted both of them to be insulted without
even putting in a word of protest.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d never heard of this confounded
bunch of wonders,” he said in audible tones.</p>

<p>A glance over his shoulder showed Dave
looming up close behind and the water-carrier
tramping across the lot with his heavy burden.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m mad clean through, Brandon,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
snapped Victor. “Don’t take my arm. No;
I won’t listen.”</p>

<p>He did, however. Dave had a way that
was hard to resist. The historian’s job was
not an easy one, but there were so many interesting
sights and sounds connected with
“Spudger’s Peerless” that the angry look on
Victor’s face gradually faded away.</p>

<p>After every portion of the grounds had been
visited Victor spoke up.</p>

<p>“It’s time to get over to the wharf, Brandon,”
he said. “Guess by this time Somers
has talked Uncle Ralph off his feet.”</p>

<p>“Then, to save him from serious injury,
we’ll hurry,” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to say good-bye to your
new-found friend, ‘Mister’ Joe Rodgers?”</p>

<p>“A queer little chap,” mused Dave. “Guess
I’ll never see him again.”</p>

<p>“And I certainly hope I never shall,” voiced
the other, with a growl.</p>

<p>When the two arrived at the wharf an
amazing howl of dismay from Victor was
Dave Brandon’s first intimation that something
extraordinary had happened.</p>

<p>The “Fearless” was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>DESERTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Victor</span> stared at Dave in unconcealed astonishment.</p>

<p>“Hello! What do you think of that, Brandon?”
he gasped. “The yacht has actually
gone off without me.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, Vic!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s right before my eyes—only I
can’t see it?” exclaimed Victor, witheringly.
“Or maybe you think Uncle Ralph is putting
the ‘Fearless’ through some funny capers a
mile up in the sky?”</p>

<p>“It’s a kind of puzzle, I’ll admit. But——”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it a little bit,” broke in Victor,
beginning to pace the wharf. “Uncle
Ralph intended to leave at ten. It’s nine-fifteen
now.”</p>

<p>“Very likely he has taken Bob and Charlie
on a short cruise,” suggested Dave, consolingly.</p>

<p>“What for, I’d like to know?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“So should I.”</p>

<p>“Looks mighty queer to me.” A heavy
scowl rested on Victor’s face. “Let’s get off
this old pile of boards, and——”</p>

<p>“Go back to the hotel, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You suppose wrong, as usual. In the
mood I’m in I might give the by-law committee
what I almost handed to Joe Rodgers.
Back to that fine combination of Spudger and
Whiffin.”</p>

<p>“But there’s three-quarters of an hour to
spare, and the yacht is almost sure to be back
within that time,” objected Dave, glancing at
his watch.</p>

<p>“I won’t wait.”</p>

<p>Dave’s resourcefulness was called into play.
By means of a vigorous argument he managed
to prolong their stay for a few moments, at
the expiration of which he found himself
alone. Laughing softly, he sat down on a
box on the edge of the wharf.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock arrived. Dave took another
careful survey of the river, but, seeing no
signs of the motor yacht, he accordingly
walked off to join the figure loitering in the
distance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“I knew it wouldn’t be there,” was Victor’s
greeting.</p>

<p>“Perhaps in a quarter of an hour——” began
the stout boy.</p>

<p>“Nix,” interrupted Victor. “Uncle Ralph
has kept me waiting; I’ll keep him waiting.
I’m going to the circus.”</p>

<p>“Tyrant!” laughed Dave. “Lead on,
Prince. I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>“Here now: don’t you start any funny
prattling, Brownie. My name is Victor.”</p>

<p>“Human nature is indeed a curious study,”
sighed the historian.</p>

<p>After another trip to Spudger’s the boys
started for the wharf again.</p>

<p>“Gee, if Uncle Ralph isn’t there by this
time I’ll give it up,” remarked Victor.</p>

<p>Uncle Ralph wasn’t there. And if Victor
did give it up he kept right on talking.</p>

<p>The lad’s face reflected his keen disappointment.
He was beginning to feel very angry
and disgusted. He was also extremely mystified.
What could it mean?</p>

<p>“It looks as if I’m going to get cheated out
of that dandy motor yacht trip to-day, Brandon.”
The scowling lines on his forehead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
deepened. “By George, I never felt so mad
in all my life. It’s after eleven, now.”</p>

<p>The two were so busily engaged in conversation
that they failed to notice a little fat man
who presently emerged from a shanty not far
away and ambled slowly out on the wharf
toward them.</p>

<p>With his face wreathed in smiles he approached,
coughing in a sort of apologetic
fashion as he said, touching his cap:</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, gents, but I’d like to speak
to ye jist a moment.”</p>

<p>Victor eyed his slouchy figure with a disdainful
stare.</p>

<p>“No—no; not even a cent!” he exclaimed
almost spitefully. “You’re husky enough to
work. Go hustle after a job!”</p>

<p>The humorous light instantly left the little
fat man’s eyes, to be followed by such a ferocious
expression that Victor thought it wise to
walk briskly away.</p>

<p>“Wal, if it don’t beat all,” growled the offended
citizen. He struck the palm of his
hand a savage blow. “Wonder what the captain
’ud say to that?”</p>

<p>Finding no answer to this perplexing problem,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
he started to follow the retreating lads;
then, apparently reconsidering, stopped short.</p>

<p>“They kin find out for theirselves,” he
grunted, decidedly.</p>

<p>When Victor, a few moments later, shot a
glance over his shoulder he saw the man
walking slowly away from the wharf.</p>

<p>“The idea of a husky lump like that asking
for money!” he sniffed.</p>

<p>“He didn’t,” returned Dave.</p>

<p>“Well, he was going to. I’m glad I called
him down. And I don’t care what you say,
Brandon, there’s something funny about this
boat business,” Victor almost screeched.</p>

<p>“We’ll go right over to the hotel now, and
see Tom,” said Dave, firmly.</p>

<p>There was a significance in his manner
which Victor had already learned to comprehend—it
meant that his wishes were to be
obeyed. Fuming with impatience, and feeling
a deep sense of personal injury at the way
things had gone, he followed his companion.</p>

<p>“The garage is on our way,” remarked
Dave, a few minutes later. “I want to see if
that motor car has been made ready for our
trip.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Benjamin Rochester, the colored lad, with
an oily rag and a can of gasoline in his hand,
looked up quickly as their forms were silhouetted
against the open doorway.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de land’s sake,” he gasped, “I thought
you fellers had done gone!”</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Dave.</p>

<p>He looked sharply around the garage. But
the huge form of the Rambler Club’s motor
car was not revealed to his eager gaze.</p>

<p>“What has become of our car, Benjamin?”
he demanded, sternly.</p>

<p>“De lan’ sake! You didn’t know?”</p>

<p>“Now what’s coming, I wonder!” growled
Victor.</p>

<p>“Why, dat tall young gemman has jist
took it away, suh,” answered Benjamin, scenting
a mystery, and beginning to show the
whites of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Took it away?” exclaimed Dave, incredulously.
“You can’t mean that our Tom
took the machine away?”</p>

<p>“Fo’ de lan’s sake! An’ yo’ didn’t know?”</p>

<p>“Well, this beats the Dutch, and the
American, and the English, all put together!”
exploded Victor, so fiercely that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Benjamin, somewhat startled, side-stepped
out of range.</p>

<p>“And where was he going?”</p>

<p>“To Milwaukee, suh.”</p>

<p>“To Milwaukee?” echoed Dave and Victor,
almost in the same breath.</p>

<p>“Dat’s perxactly what he done said, suh.”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in amazement.
Victor clenched his small fists and
whistled shrilly, while Dave gazed thoughtfully
at the grinning countenance of Benjamin
Rochester.</p>

<p>“Tom gone to Milwaukee!” he murmured,
in highly perplexed tones. “And left no
message for us?”</p>

<p>“No, suh; de gemman didn’t say nuffin,”
answered Benjamin. He wagged his head
knowingly. “But I had me s’picions, suh;
’deed I had. He acted awful queer, like he
were done skeered, suh; an’ kep’ a-lookin’ an’
a-lookin’.”</p>

<p>“Here, Brownie”—Victor Collins seized
Dave’s wrist and fairly dragged him toward
the door—“come right along. I’ve got an
idea.”</p>

<p>The instant they were outside, Victor, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
eyes sparkling, stopped by the curb and began
a broadside.</p>

<p>“Say, Brandon, remember how I kidded
Clifton this morning?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he was actually thin-skinned
enough to believe I really meant it. I’ll bet
he went tearing over to Uncle Ralph and jollied
him into going off without me.”</p>

<p>“What a ridiculous idea, Vic!” laughed
Dave. “Why should Tom have done such a
thing?”</p>

<p>Victor eyed him scornfully.</p>

<p>“Just to get ahead of the game, that’s why.
Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, Vic.”</p>

<p>“Then brush up your perceptive faculties
a bit. Here it is a second time: he was so
afraid that I might get Uncle Ralph to take
you chaps to Milwaukee as a joke—see?—that
he sets his wits to work, goes over to the yacht
to find out, discovers that you and I are at the
circus, and plays the joke first. See again?”</p>

<p>“Bob and Charlie would never have stood
for such a thing,” declared Dave.</p>

<p>“They would!” returned Victor. “And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
know Uncle Ralph; he’s just the one to fall
for a game like that.”</p>

<p>The stout boy raised his hand protestingly.</p>

<p>“Why, Vic!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ‘why Vic’ me!” snapped Victor.
“I tell you, Uncle Ralph Bunderley probably
sat down and roared.”</p>

<p>“You won’t think so when you feel in a
better humor,” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you say, Brandon; that’s
the way I figure it out. Anyway, if that long-legged
Indian did engineer it”—he flourished
his fists savagely—“he’ll stop a few of these!”</p>

<p>“Let’s try and reason——”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any reason to it. That Clifton
fellow has just turned the trick; he’s getting
square for some of the true things I said about
him.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon you’ll stand up for that grand
and perfect Clifton. Honest, though, I didn’t
think the sly, foxy Indian would do Brownie
up brown like this.”</p>

<p>Dave, refusing to countenance such an idea,
propounded theory after theory, each of which
his companion promptly rejected.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“There’s no use talking, Brandon,” he exclaimed,
at length. “I declare, I’m mad
enough to punch his head off. The yacht’s
gone; the gasoline tank’s gone; and we’re here
in Kenosha.”</p>

<p>“And I’m likely to stay for some time to
come, unless the fellows turn up.”</p>

<p>The worried expression on the historian’s
face gave place to a broad grin.</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Victor.</p>

<p>“Because I’m stranded—broke—cast into
the seething vortex of life without gold, silver,
nickel, or even copper to lend me a helping
hand.”</p>

<p>“How in the dickens did such a thing as
that happen?”</p>

<p>“It’s this way, Vic: after I’d paid my way
out to Chicago I didn’t have a red cent left.
So I was obliged to throw myself on the tender
mercies of the crowd until we reach Milwaukee.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this all another joke?” queried
Victor, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, Vic.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they’ve been lending you cash
how is it you’re broke?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“I was going to get another five from Bob
this morning.”</p>

<p>Victor’s eyes began to twinkle. Then, like
a flash, his mood completely changed. A
wide grin merged into a laugh; his slender
form shook with a perfect storm of merriment,
while Benjamin, from the doorway, looked on
with wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“My, oh my, but don’t I feel sorry for you,
Brownie!” he gasped, between another succession
of outbursts. “Broke? Gee! I’ll bet
you are just shaking in your shoes.”</p>

<p>Dave smiled calmly.</p>

<p>“Maybe so, Vic,” he returned, good-naturedly.
“Perhaps our stay in Kenosha may
add more pages to my history than I anticipated.”</p>

<p>To Victor’s mind there was something extremely
comical in Dave Brandon’s unexpected
situation. His face now actually beamed.
Things were at last breaking in a way to suit
him. Without a move on his part, events
had so shaped themselves that at least one
member of the Rambler Club was likely
to come tumbling down several pegs in a
hurry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Victor wasn’t really such a bad chap. He
simply possessed an over-supply of the weaknesses
of human nature, which had been
fostered—unintentionally, of course—by a too-indulgent
parent.</p>

<p>“I’ll lend the big Indian just as much of
the cash as he wants,” reflected the boy, “but
he’ll have to get off his high perch and ask
me for it. Gee, won’t I laugh when the great
depending-upon-himself fellow hollers for
help!”</p>

<p>In a moment, slapping Dave on the shoulder,
he said:</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Go back to the hotel. Perhaps Tom may
have left some message for us.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>With a sigh, Dave started off.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Benjamin,” he called, catching
sight of the wondering colored lad. “I only
hope this is ‘much ado about nothing,’
or——”</p>

<p>“It won’t be any ‘Tempest in a teapot’
when I get hold of Wyoming Tom,” said
Victor, decidedly; “and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p>“Dar am sartingly somethin’ queer ’bout dat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
dar bunch,” murmured Benjamin Rochester,
shaking his head knowingly.</p>

<p>When the two arrived at the hotel the clerk
told them that Tom had left no message.</p>

<p>“Of course the tall Indian didn’t!” exclaimed
the smaller lad.</p>

<p>To his astonishment, Dave ambled slowly
into the reception room and took a seat.</p>

<p>“I say, Brownie,” remarked Victor, “I’m
going out to get some grub.”</p>

<p>“Hope you’ll enjoy it,” came an easy response.</p>

<p>“Why in thunder doesn’t he ask?” thought
Victor. Then, aloud, he added:</p>

<p>“Aren’t you hungry, Brownie?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Vic; always am.”</p>

<p>“Coming, then?”</p>

<p>“Can’t!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“For obvious reasons, my dear sir.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Wants me to offer it to him.
Not on your life!” was another of Victor’s
reflections. “How are you going to manage,
Brandon?”</p>

<p>“Time will tell, Vic.”</p>

<p>The Chicago boy stood, irresolute; his better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
nature prompted him to offer assistance. But
the slights Victor imagined he had suffered
suddenly flashed into his mind.</p>

<p>“No; I won’t do it. If the duffer is too
all-fired proud to speak up he’ll get out of his
fix the best way he can.”</p>

<p>“No use to wait for me, Vic,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Brandon. So-long!”</p>

<p>Once outside the room, however, Victor’s
conscience smote him. He walked back and
poked his head inside the doorway. “I’ll
give him another chance,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>“Say, Brandon, what’s your program?”</p>

<p>“Time will tell, Vic,” responded the stout
boy.</p>

<p>With a snort of disgust, Victor turned on
his heel.</p>

<p>“This ought to teach the big Indian a jolly
good lesson,” he muttered, fiercely. “After a
while he’ll be singing a mighty different
tune.”</p>

<p>When Victor Collins, refreshed by an ample
repast, returned to the hotel he received his
third surprise of the day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>TOM AT THE WHEEL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moment the door had closed behind
his friends Tom Clifton prepared to make good
use of the time.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll be able to finish it up in great
shape,” he said softly to himself.</p>

<p>He listened, his face wearing a very serious
expression, until their cheery voices were stilled
by distance, then drawing a voluminous collection
of papers from his inside pocket he
spread them out carefully on the center table
and set to work.</p>

<p>Evidently the problems which confronted
him were of a very profound and complex
nature. The lines on his forehead deepened;
occasionally he uttered a half sigh, as some
particularly knotty point was encountered;
then, losing patience, he rose to his feet and
walked toward an armchair near the window.</p>

<p>Picking up a book, the well-worn appearance
of which indicated much usage, he opened it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
at random and began to read a description of
the deltoid muscle, its origin, insertion and
various functions.</p>

<p>But a treatise on anatomy, just then, couldn’t
hold Tom’s attention long.</p>

<p>“By George, that twenty-second article is a
sticker,” he exclaimed, aloud. “I’ll get it
through.” He looked at his watch. “Gee,
I’ll have to hurry. Isn’t Victor the freshest
little dub? Afraid to take the car out alone,
am I? He certainly does make me tired.”</p>

<p>When the obstinate twenty-second article
was finally conquered the lad breathed a sigh
of relief, and a good-natured grin replaced the
scowl on his face, as he began gathering the
loose sheets of paper together.</p>

<p>“It’s a dandy piece of work, all right—bet
Dave’ll think so, too,” he reflected. “We’re
going to make some stir in the Kingswood
High this term.”</p>

<p>Tom busied himself for a few moments in
replacing his belongings in a suit case. This
done, he glanced at his watch once more.</p>

<p>“It’s most time for ’em now,” he murmured.
“Crickets! I’m anxious to hop into that car
again.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Thoughts of the pleasant journey before
them and the sensation which his by-laws
were certainly bound to create were in his
mind to the exclusion of all else, but, as time
passed by, the former steadily gained the
ascendency.</p>

<p>“What’s keeping those chaps, I wonder?”
Tom, in his impatience, paced the floor.
“They ought to have been here before this.”</p>

<p>The next quarter of an hour was really a
distressing period to the tall boy. Every step
in the corridor, every voice which penetrated
into the room, made his heart beat with hope.
But as each faded away it left him annoyed,
even angry.</p>

<p>“Never knew Bob Somers to fail in his
word before,” he repeated several times.</p>

<p>Unable to stand the dreary task of waiting
any longer Tom slapped on his cap, and, in a
moment, was down-stairs at the door.</p>

<p>He looked searchingly along the street in
both directions. But there were no familiar
faces in the ever-passing throng.</p>

<p>“Hang it all,” he growled. “If we were in
Chicago I might understand it, because there’s
a fire every few minutes, or some kind of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
rumpus going on. But here!—Why don’t
those chaps come back?”</p>

<p>No answer was suggested by the mental
query which insistently propounded itself; so,
finally, with a last long look and grunt of disapproval,
Tom climbed back to Bob Somers’
room. The book on anatomy reappeared, and
the student, with an air of deep injury, once
more began to read.</p>

<p>It was, at length, fully fifteen minutes beyond
the time appointed for the yacht to leave.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom sat bolt upright. He seemed
as startled as though some one had clapped
him unexpectedly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Could it be possible?</p>

<p>He drew a long, deep breath. A dreadful
suspicion had entered his head. He tried to
cast it off with scorn; but, somehow, the
thought would not down. Were the boys
testing his courage? Had they actually gone
away with Victor on the motor yacht? Did
the crowd wish to find out how he stood in
relation to the “flopper” class? And yet it
wasn’t like honest, straightforward Bob Somers
to act in such a way.</p>

<p>The precious book of anatomy fell unheeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
to the floor, as Tom restlessly paced up and
down, while conflicting ideas chased each
other swiftly through his brain.</p>

<p>“I don’t—can’t believe it,” he said, aloud.
“Of course not! What a silly idiot I am.
The crowd’ll be here soon. Mustn’t let ’em
think they had me aeroplaning.” He smiled
grimly as an idea struck him. “I’ll just
sprint down to the wharf and settle it.”</p>

<p>So Tom, with unseemly haste, again dashed
down-stairs, and did almost “sprint” through
the streets in the direction of the river. It
was quite a long distance, too, but probably
few had ever covered it in so short a time.</p>

<p>The moment his eyes rested on the familiar
pilings at which Captain Bunderley’s motor
yacht was usually moored he stopped short
and uttered a low whistle. His suspicions
were not without foundation, after all.</p>

<p>The “Fearless” had gone.</p>

<p>Yes, the “Fearless” had gone! There
could be no doubt about it. Tom Clifton felt
a strange variety of emotions assail him. He
eagerly scanned the river, half expecting to
see the yacht somewhere on its surface. But
his search was in vain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Well, well! Victor must have actually
managed to pull off that trick,” he growled.</p>

<p>Smarting with indignation, the lad covered
the space between him and the end of the
wharf in record time.</p>

<p>A small, stout man sitting on a barrel looked
up as he approached.</p>

<p>“Hey,” began Tom, “were you here this
morning when that motor yacht left?”</p>

<p>The stout man, with a whimsical light in
his eye, was gazing hard into the boy’s face.</p>

<p>“Yer hat is a great distance up from the
ground, me lad,” he remarked, casually.
“Kin ye see acrost to the lake from there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out. I’m no lighthouse!”
snapped Tom, forgetting politeness in his ruffled
state of mind. “Were you——”</p>

<p>The stout man stopped him.</p>

<p>“I were, for sure,” he answered, emphatically.</p>

<p>“See any boys on board?”</p>

<p>“I did—sure ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Been gone long?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a right smart spell. Runned off
without yer, did they, mate? Some people is
mean enough for anythin’.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Tom was too angry and disturbed to make
any reply to this observation.</p>

<p>“My, but wouldn’t I like to punch that
little Victor,” he thought. “I didn’t think it
of Bob Somers; or Dave, either. Looks as
though the whole bunch is trying to have a
big joke at my expense. Hey?”</p>

<p>The little man was speaking again.</p>

<p>“Ye oughter be real glad ye weren’t took
along, mate,” he remarked, pleasantly. “Ye
look kinder peart now; but a right smart
spell o’ tossin’ about out there ’ud take that
out o’ you. I always says, give me seasoned
water every time.”</p>

<p>“Seasoned water?” queried Tom.</p>

<p>“Sure, mate; some as has plenty o’ salt in
it. I’ve sailed on both kinds, an’ I know.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose the lake makes you feel
a bit peppery at times, eh?” grunted Tom, as
he strode rapidly away.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” he exclaimed, hotly,
when out of hearing distance. “Isn’t this the
limit! A dandy trip bungled at the very
start; and all on account of that little spoiled
kid. By George, they certainly have put it
up to me to take our car to Milwaukee all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
alone. Think I’ll ‘flop,’ eh, as Victor calls
it? Well, I rather guess not!”</p>

<p>Tom looked very savage indeed; his fists
were tightly clenched, and he glared about
him in a way that might have attracted attention
had any observers been near.</p>

<p>The cool gusts of wind which continually
swept against the lad, together with the busy
scenes along the wharves, finally began to
calm his belligerent spirit. The first effect of
the unpleasant situation wearing off left him
with a dogged feeling of determination to
show his mettle.</p>

<p>Presently Tom sat down on an old box,
from which position he had a good view of
the river. But another period of waiting
brought no result, and he rose to his feet more
disgusted than ever.</p>

<p>His mind had been busily engaged. He
did not intend to let any one, even his best
friends, play jokes on him.</p>

<p>“If the bunch doesn’t turn up mighty fast,”
he reflected, “I’ll have a little fun in that car
all by my lonesome. No doubt now—it’s
Milwaukee for mine.”</p>

<p>The boys didn’t turn up. Whereupon Tom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
deciding that he had, with Sherlock Holmes
intelligence, made the proper deductions, went
back to the hotel. There he gathered together
the few articles of luggage which the crowd
carried with them and paid their bill.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back soon with the car,” he explained,
briefly, to the clerk.</p>

<p>At the garage the proprietor was mildly
surprised to see only the very tall lad returning
to take charge of the motor car, but, concluding
that it was none of his affair, he made
no comments.</p>

<p>The machine seemed to have increased
marvelously in size since Tom had last seen
it. In the midst of other vehicles it loomed
up in a positively gigantic fashion. How
easily he could picture in his mind Dave
Brandon lolling in comfort on the rear seat.
What a strange, dismal silence hovered over
the big car now! A peculiar sense of loneliness
stole over him. He stood, irresolute.
Then, in an instant, and with a shrug of his
shoulders, he climbed up to the chauffeur’s
seat.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, I done filled the tank with gasoline,”
explained a smiling colored lad, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
answer to his query. “Dar ain’t nuthin’ to be
did. Whar’s ye goin’, suh, if I might ask?”</p>

<p>“To Milwaukee,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Sho, dat am sartingly a fine trip. Yes,
suh, de way am clear.”</p>

<p>Tom Clifton’s hand trembled a little as he
laid it on the steering wheel. Without the
presence of the others to strengthen his courage
the task of driving the car through the
city streets assumed more formidable proportions
than he liked. But, giving the button on
the dash a push, he muttered, determinedly:</p>

<p>“I’ll play the game right to the end.”</p>

<p>In another instant the echoes of the engine’s
rapid pulsation thundered through the garage.
A cloud of gasoline vapor swirled aloft, to lose
itself among the rafters. The clutch was
thrown on.</p>

<p>“So-long, Benjamin!”</p>

<p>“So-long, Mistah! I done hopes yo hab a
bully trip.”</p>

<p>The big touring car slid easily past the
doorway; a series of warning blasts from the
horn sounded, and Tom was on the street.</p>

<p>Once outside, with the machine responding
to his slightest touch, he soon began to feel a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
little easier in mind. Yet how empty the car
seemed! How he missed the cheery voices
and merry laughter of his companions! Why
had they allowed themselves to be so influenced
by Victor—why?</p>

<p>And then the thought that he had acted
too impulsively flashed through Tom’s mind.</p>

<p>“Suppose I should find ’em at the hotel?
They’d have a jolly good laugh at my expense,
after all,” he reflected.</p>

<p>But, on this point, he need not have disturbed
himself. Neither Victor nor any of
the others was at the hotel when the car
stopped before the entrance.</p>

<p>“Those chaps even had the confounded
cheek to leave their traps for me to look
after,” grumbled Tom, as the boy in bright
brass buttons assisted him in stowing away the
luggage. “Well, all right. The first inning
of the game’s been played. Here’s the beginning
of the second.”</p>

<p>Once more the touring car was in motion.
With all the responsibility resting on his
shoulders, the lad experienced new and novel
sensations—and most of them were not altogether
pleasant. He sadly missed Bob Somers’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
words of caution and advice. Approaching
the public square, with numerous vehicles
and pedestrians on all sides, he became decidedly
nervous.</p>

<p>Just as the car rolled toward the principal
crossing, around the corner of which Tom
decided to turn, a tall man who had been
reading a newspaper by the curb suddenly
stepped out into the street.</p>

<p>With a cry, Tom reached over and sounded
the horn sharply. He took his foot off the
clutch and threw on the break. It was an
instant of intense satisfaction to him—and,
perhaps, some surprise, when the touring car
abruptly stopped.</p>

<p>And, meanwhile, a flying leap had taken
the man to safety.</p>

<p>At the moment of landing, fully a yard
from the starting point, his temper took effect
all at once.</p>

<p>“Hey there, what’s the matter? Ain’t you
got no eyes?” he demanded, in amazingly
gruff tones.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a good one!” cried Tom,
though his voice was somewhat shaky. “How—how—about
yourself?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Don’t pass out any flip talk, now. I
won’t stand for it.”</p>

<p>“Better wait until I do.”</p>

<p>The angry citizen paused, took a good look
at the tall chauffeur, then:</p>

<p>“Why, you ain’t nothin’ but a kid!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tom’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“I’m old enough to know what I’m doing,”
he answered, witheringly.</p>

<p>“You are, hey? There ought to be a
law passed against letting fellers what ain’t
cut their eye teeth yet drive regular whaleback
ships like that through the streets.
What are you doing in there, anyway,
boy?”</p>

<p>“If you throw any more words in this direction
you may find out.”</p>

<p>“Got a license for knocking folks down,
have you?”</p>

<p>A small crowd had already gathered, and
seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the situation.</p>

<p>“Don’t let ’im faze you, chaufyer,” screeched
a very small lad.</p>

<p>Tom, making a strong effort to appear cool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and dignified, leaned forward. His eye caught
the tall man’s.</p>

<p>“I’d like to say this,” he roared: “if the
city intended the middle of the street to be
used as a place for reading newspapers they’d
have put a few benches and chairs along it.”</p>

<p>Chuckles of mirth came from the audience.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! You’ve got ’im goin’,” piped a
very youthful citizen.</p>

<p>“Goin’! He’s the one that will be goin’!”
roared the man whose life had been saved.
“Where’s there a cop? Where’s that officer I
saw on the corner a few moments ago?”</p>

<p>“If he hadn’t gone, too,” cried Tom, looking
around, “he’d pinch you for disorderly
conduct and blocking the highway. Get out
of the road. This machine is going to buzz
like a sawmill.”</p>

<p>An elderly lady, who disliked everybody
that rode in an automobile, declared to a
companion that Tom was the most brazen-looking
young scamp she had ever seen; and,
the fact is, he did not at that moment appear
very angelic.</p>

<p>Snorting indignantly, and still somewhat
unnerved, Tom threw in the clutch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>He had expected to spend some time scouting
around in the center of the city. But this
experience caused him to decide that the more
quiet streets would do just as well.</p>

<p>“That chap was certainly a grouch,” he
murmured, still highly indignant. “But I
guess my remark about the benches squelched
him.”</p>

<p>A number of blocks were passed, each instant
bringing him nearer to the wharf where
the “Fearless” had been moored.</p>

<p>“Bet, by this time, the yacht is back,” he
murmured, hopefully. “I’ll never let on how
the boys had me going, both in and out of the
car.”</p>

<p>The river soon swept into view. Tom, peering
eagerly ahead, felt his spirits sink again.
A number of boats dotted the gray, gloomy-looking
surface, but the motor yacht “Fearless”
was not among the number.</p>

<p>“Well, well! I might have known I was
right.”</p>

<p>The car came to a full stop. Tom sat for
many minutes absorbed in deep reflection.
Then a grim smile played across his features.</p>

<p>“I’ll show ’em how well I can play the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
game,” he cried once more to the empty air.
His hand gripped the horn bulb. A resounding
blast instantly followed. “There goes the
signal for the third inning. I’ll make a home
run to Milwaukee, and bob up smiling.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>SPEEDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I certainly</span> hope we don’t meet any more
mean, tricky little kids,” soliloquized Tom, as
the touring car rushed steadily ahead, each instant
leaving the city of Kenosha further and
further behind. “By George—the nerve of
him! Well—the fellows will find out that
when it comes to matching wits they haven’t
much on me.”</p>

<p>Tom Clifton’s confidence had returned; the
strange feeling of loneliness which at first had
persisted in hanging over him, as well as the
half-defined fear of something happening to
the motor were rapidly being dispelled. The
six cylinders, operating with perfect precision,
sent off on the breeze their steady vibrating
roar. Tom’s cheek was flushed with the excitement
and novelty of his position. He
seemed to have grown into man’s estate at a
bound.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“I guess when I meet the yacht at Milwaukee
I’ll have the laugh on the whole
bunch,” he thought, with a cheerful grin.</p>

<p>The weather was still threatening. A stiff,
cold breeze constantly blowing in his face
made the goggles very acceptable indeed, and
he had found it prudent to put on his heavier
coat. Now and again he caught glimpses of
Lake Michigan. Far out on the great body
of agitated water he could see tossing whitecaps
gleaming like silver against the gray
background of choppy waves.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder if I got caught in an
awful blow before long,” he said aloud, somewhat
anxiously.</p>

<p>At times the route took him not far from
the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad. Occasionally
trains thundered by, their whistles
sending shrieking blasts that died out in
throbbing echoes over the dreary landscape.</p>

<p>Tom felt an almost irresistible impulse to
throw on all power and race these defiant-looking
iron monsters, but thoughts of the law
and of sharp-eyed constables deterred him.</p>

<p>At length a village sprang into view ahead.
On closer inspection it seemed to have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
usual accompaniments of barking dogs, cackling
geese, and countless chickens.</p>

<p>Only by the narrowest margin were several
terrible casualties among the bird family
averted that day. Tom’s heart beat fast with
apprehension as a small army of geese, led by
an ancient gander, suddenly swooped directly
in the path of the oncoming machine.</p>

<p>The fierce yells of a blue-shirted man leaning
against a fence did not help to ease his
troubled spirit.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!”</p>

<p>The words broke impulsively from Tom’s
lips, as, with frantic haste, he operated the
steering wheel.</p>

<p>For an instant he expected to hear an awful
cackling ringing in his ears. But the big
touring car swerved sufficiently to clear the
rear guard of frantically flying legs.</p>

<p>“By George! And never even ruffled a
feather!” cried Tom, in great relief.</p>

<p>The village was quickly passed. On reaching
a bend a stretch of almost straight road
lay before him. The country looked very
deserted and lonely. Here and there a house,
far off in the fields, patches of trees, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
crooked line of a fence alone broke the monotonous
landscape.</p>

<p>The temptation to “burn up the road” was
too great to resist. Tom threw on power until
the telegraph poles seemed to be literally
hurling themselves through space toward
him. He had certainly recovered his nerve,
a fact on which he proudly congratulated
himself.</p>

<p>But the thrills produced by the terrific
speed were of no ordinary kind, causing him
before long to slow down considerably.</p>

<p>“Gee! Now I’ve done it, I won’t do it
again,” he muttered, with all the elation of a
chauffeur who has captured a world’s record.
“Awful risky, that! Maybe Bob Somers
wouldn’t have opened his eyes. Hello—Racine!”</p>

<p>Beyond an open field houses were coming
into view, and still further beyond several
church spires pierced the lowering atmosphere.</p>

<p>At a moderate speed, Tom kept on, while
evidences that a busy, thriving town lay ahead
constantly increased. Before long the machine
was rolling over a wide, pleasant avenue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
lined with houses set some distance apart,
many having fine lawns in front.</p>

<p>As the character of the street changed so
did Tom’s feelings. When the livelier sections
of the city were reached nervousness
once again had him in its grip. But, with
firm determination, he mastered the tremors
which, for a time, threatened to interfere with
his manipulation of the steering wheel.</p>

<p>“Easy, boy—easy!” he counseled to himself.</p>

<p>The big machine was rounding a corner
which reminded him of the one in Kenosha.
“Main Street,” he read on a near-by sign.</p>

<p>“Pretty brisk, too,” murmured Tom.
“Must be a busy time of day.”</p>

<p>Clang, clang, clang!</p>

<p>In response to the insistent warnings of a
rapidly-approaching electric car he drew near
the curb. Then a two-horse dray swung
sharply off from the car tracks and compelled
him to come to a stop.</p>

<p>Tom was just in the humor to call out
gruffly:</p>

<p>“Hey, there! Where are you going?”</p>

<p>But the trolley car at that instant whizzed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
rapidly past, and the boy concluded, just in
time to check the remark, that the driver of
the dray was justified in his action.</p>

<p>This far from exciting incident was the only
one which marked the passage of the motor
car through the streets of Racine. Tom, however,
drew a long, deep breath of relief when
clanging gongs, blasts of automobile horns
and the rattle of wagons were but a memory
and the open country lay stretched once more
before him.</p>

<p>In the middle distance the moisture-laden
air seemed to dip down, and through this veil
the views beyond were revealed in misty
patches. Every minute it looked as if the
scudding clouds would begin to dissolve themselves
in torrents of driving rain. All vegetation
glistened with cold gray reflections
caught from above. Yet, as the motor car
sent the mile-stones, one after another, slipping
past, the expected did not happen.</p>

<p>“It will mighty soon, though, I’m thinking,”
mused Tom. “By gum, this is rather
lonely work. Houses ahead! Good! Signs
of life out here are certainly scarce.”</p>

<p>It was a very pretty little village along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
principal street of which the car presently
rolled. He caught several glimpses of men
working in fields; of others gathered in front
of a store. They hailed him; he sent an answering
salute; then, in a few moments, the
last house had been reached and passed.</p>

<p>As the journey approached its end Tom
Clifton’s impatience increased. Several times
he drove the car for short stretches at a clip
which almost rivaled his first daring attempt
at speeding. Another village was passed, and
then another. Some distance to his right an
occasional column of rapidly-moving smoke
or jets of steam marked the progress of north
or south-bound trains.</p>

<p>“Easy job—I didn’t have any trouble finding
the way,” grinned Tom. “One look at
our road map was enough. By George; it’s a
lucky thing, too, that I remember the place
where Captain Bunderley said his motor yacht
was always moored at Milwaukee. ‘Right by
the East Water Street bridge, boys,’—those
were his very words. She ought to have arrived
by this time. And I know how to steer
the machine there straight as a carrier pigeon
scoots for home.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Hey there, young feller!”</p>

<p>The motor car was nearing an intersecting
road. It bore an appearance strangely similar
to numerous others passed that day, but
whereas they had generally been deserted on
this particular one he saw a small slight man
of uncertain age sprinting toward him at a
lively rate of speed.</p>

<p>“Hey there, young feller!” came the hail
a second time.</p>

<p>In obedience to the authoritative summons,
Tom slowed up, stopping just as the man,
breathing hard, reached the main road.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>THE CONSTABLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rambler’s gaze rested upon an odd-looking
man who wore a gray beard. His
skin was tanned to a coppery color; around
his eyes innumerable wrinkles had formed,
giving to his face a curious quizzical expression.</p>

<p>“Goodness—a county constable!” thought
Tom.</p>

<p>The first words he heard confirmed this unpleasant
suspicion.</p>

<p>“You’ve been scorchin’, ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>“Scorching?” howled Tom, indignantly.
“Why, I never even scorched a biscuit.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good one. I saw ye.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! It was only a reasonable rate of
speed.”</p>

<p>“How many good telegraph poles did ye
knock down along the route?” asked Tom’s
questioner, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I put every one right back in its place.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“You look like one o’ them pampered fellers.
Most likely yer dad’s a millionaire.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort!” broke in Tom, impatiently.</p>

<p>“What ain’t?”</p>

<p>“What you said.”</p>

<p>“What I said ain’t nothin’ o’ the sort, eh?
Wal, it’ll go easier with yer if ye ain’t forgot
the politeness ye l’arned in early youth.
Back there”—he waved a brown finger in
the air—“ye scorched; own up now!” His
words were jerked out with incisive emphasis.
“Own up now!”</p>

<p>“Maybe I did go a little fast,” admitted
Tom, hesitatingly, “but—but—here! What
are you doing?”</p>

<p>The countryman, without waiting for anything
further, had calmly stepped on the running
board. He leaned over to open the door.</p>

<p>Next instant the highly-indignant chauffeur
saw him climbing into the car.</p>

<p>“The court-house ain’t so very far,” announced
the unexpected passenger, calmly
seating himself on the rear cushions. “Cheer
up, young feller. ’Twon’t be more’n fifteen
dollars; an’ if ye hain’t got it the county allus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
takes good keer o’ the machine till ye comes
out.”</p>

<p>“This is a pretty kettle of fish!” cried
Tom, hotly.</p>

<p>“Some o’ the prettiest fish I ever see has
been ketched right around here, son. But
don’t let yer machine git rusty. Even machine
oil has riz in price.”</p>

<p>Tom was too disgusted to make any rejoinder.
He turned his head, to stare hard
into a pair of twinkling gray eyes. An awkward
silence followed.</p>

<p>“Did you mistake this for a sightseeing
car?” demanded Tom, at length. “Please
step right out!”</p>

<p>The other grinned complacently.</p>

<p>“I’m only a little bunch,” he confided,
“but when I worked in lumber camps me
pals said I were as strong as a steel trap; and
that’s pretty near so. Nobody has ever put
me off an automobile yit.” He laughed softly.
“Feel like trying it?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Tom, wrathfully.</p>

<p>The man settled the matter beyond all
question. From an inside pocket he produced
a small, ominous-looking shield.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“How does that strike ye?” he asked, mildly.</p>

<p>“Then you’re a—a constable, after all?”</p>

<p>“If ye’d guessed a year ye couldn’t hev
guessed better. This is a free country; but
when the majesty o’ the law has been damaged
fifteen dollars’ worth——”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t scorch—an’ you know it!”
cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Softly, young feller. It’s lucky for you
Jack Piker didn’t see that last lap o’ yourn,
that’s all. I’m an easier man than him.”</p>

<p>“I could have gone twice as fast,” insisted
Clifton, angrily.</p>

<p>“So much the worse if ye had.”</p>

<p>The boy pleaded and coaxed. There was no
reason why he should be delayed; he was going
moderately fast, but not at any rate of speed that
could be considered illegal. None of his arguments,
however, appeared to have the slightest
effect upon the little man on the rear seat. Occasionally
a low, chuckling laugh escaped him.
The lines around his eyes deepened.</p>

<p>“When you git finished start ’er up,” he
commanded, firmly.</p>

<p>And Tom, fairly boiling over with indignation,
“started up.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>He squared his shoulders; his jaws clicked
together.</p>

<p>“And it’s all on account of that miserable
Victor Collins,” he muttered. “Never mind!
I haven’t been touched out at first yet. Wait
till I get before the justice!”</p>

<p>Tom had so many thoughts to keep his
mind occupied that the next town emerged
into view through the gloomy haze ahead
with surprising suddenness.</p>

<p>“South Milwaukee,” announced a gruff
voice from the rear.</p>

<p>Tom scorned to reply.</p>

<p>The hum of smoothly-working machinery,
the soft whirr of wheels and the chant and
moan of the wind were the only sounds which
broke the silence as the distance became less
and less.</p>

<p>Finally the motor car was on the principal
street of the town. Tom had been expecting
every instant to receive orders to proceed at
once to the hall where justice held full sway,
but, so far, the little man, beyond hailing several
acquaintances with considerable enthusiasm,
had remained silent.</p>

<p>“Ah—now it comes!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>A long finger was tapping his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Stop!” commanded the passenger.</p>

<p>Tom looked hastily about him, but could
see no building suggestive of a court-house.</p>

<p>The machine drew up to the curb and came
to a halt.</p>

<p>“I certainly am much obliged to you, son.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What do you mean?” queried Tom,
in surprise.</p>

<p>The little man’s eyes were twinkling merrily.
Suddenly he burst into a series of loud guffaws,
while young Clifton’s look of astonishment
momentarily increased.</p>

<p>“Ain’t I speakin’ English?”</p>

<p>“Hang it all; I—I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Of course ye don’t. But ask
anybody nigh-abouts who knows Jerry Dinglar
an’ they’d tell ye he’s the greatest practical
joker in town. I simply can’t help it.”</p>

<p>“You—you—surely don’t mean that this is
all a lark, do you?” exclaimed Tom, hopefully.</p>

<p>One square look into Mr. Dinglar’s eyes was
enough to reveal the truth.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!”</p>

<p>Tom breathed a sigh of relief. He felt so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
joyous that his anger melted entirely away.
Willingly he seized and shook the lean brown
hand which was thrust toward him, suppressing
with difficulty a desire to indulge in boisterous
mirth.</p>

<p>“Only a joke!” he exclaimed. “Ha, ha!—But”—his
face suddenly became grave
again—“aren’t you really a constable?”</p>

<p>“I’m the greatest stickler for facts you ever
heard of,” confided Mr. Dinglar. “Sure I am
a constable. Now let me tell you somethin’—let
it soak in good, too: back there ain’t in
my jurisdiction; Piker attends to that most o’
the time, an’ I’m generally off to the north o’
here. But I wanted to git a lift inter town—understan’?
An’ when I see a young
chap comin’ along swift as an Injun arrow
I makes up my mind to hev it. See the
p’int?”</p>

<p>Tom admitted that he caught the idea.</p>

<p>“But why in thunder didn’t you just ask
me?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Jerry Dinglar shook his head.</p>

<p>“Me friends all like me well enough, but
I’ll wager they’d give somethin’ big if I’d only
move out o’ the county, yes, they would.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
His chuckling laugh came again. “See the
p’int?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded.</p>

<p>“I had to hev my little joke; an’ you look
enough like my own son to be his brother.”</p>

<p>Tom turned his face away to hide a rather
odd expression.</p>

<p>“Only he ain’t stretched out to ’most the
breakin’ p’int, as you are,” added the official.
“Anyway, it made me do you a good turn.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Tom, interestedly.</p>

<p>“If Jack Piker had saw what I see’d it
would hev been fifteen dollars’ worth o’ law
busted, sure. Better take advice o’ one who
introduces automobile fellers to the judge
every week—be keerful; don’t do it ag’in.
That’s what I was wantin’ ter impress on yer
mind—understan’?” The little man clapped
him on the shoulder. “I don’t know where
ye come from, an’ I don’t know where ye’re
goin’, but I like ye, ’cause you kin take a joke.
See the p’int?”</p>

<p>Tom grinned.</p>

<p>“Sure! Some chaps are so thin-skinned
they get mad at everything,” he said, loftily.</p>

<p>“That’s it. Good-bye, an’ much obleeged!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
And, with these words, the little constable
hopped nimbly to the ground, gave a parting
wave of his hand and walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>“By George, that’s a comical one for you,”
said Tom, to himself. “I feel just like a chap
who has beaten the ball to first. Ha, ha! I
wasn’t scorching, though; that is, not when
he saw me. But still”—he smiled rather
grimly—“I’d better be on the safe side and
crawl the rest of the way.”</p>

<p>Once more the machine was in motion.
South Milwaukee soon fell far behind and
within a half hour he was approaching the
city. A confused mass of buildings, and an
occasional chimney rising high above them,
lifted themselves faintly from obscurity.
Here and there factory smoke raced with the
low-hanging clouds and deepened their lowering
surfaces into a still darker tone.</p>

<p>Tom paid no heed to the depressing air of
gloom which seemed to pervade all nature.
He was too anxious to reach the East Water
Street bridge and bring his lonely trip to a close.</p>

<p>And suppose the motor yacht “Fearless”
should not be there, after all?</p>

<p>This unpleasant thought, occasionally penetrating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Tom’s armor of confidence, brought
an expression of deep concern to his face.</p>

<p>“Well, in that case, I suppose I’ll have
to play the game some more,” he sighed.
“Anyway, it’s up to me to make good; and I
will.”</p>

<p>The outskirts were quickly passed. The
scattering array of houses gave place to thickly
built up sections, which, as he progressed, became
more and more lively. At length Tom
drove along Kinnikinnic Avenue, finally crossing
the river of the same name. Then the
motor car swung into Clinton Street, and, on a
straight road, leaped forward, overtaking and
nosing past every vehicle bound in the same
direction.</p>

<p>Tom, in his impatience, forgot all self-consciousness,
handling the car with a skill almost
equal to that of Bob Somers’. His heart
was beating high with hope and expectancy.</p>

<p>A deep, hoarse whistle vibrating over the
air told of traffic on the Milwaukee River.
The sound brought with it, too, the pleasing
message that his goal was almost reached.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes he would know—what?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Up to the limit of speed allowed by law
dashed the motor car, Tom eagerly straining
his eyes for the first glimpse of the East
Water Street bridge, which, according to his
map, must be just ahead.</p>

<p>“Ah ha; there it is!”</p>

<p>The draw was opening to allow a boat to
pass. Tom saw the great arms of the structure
rising higher and higher against the sky.
To the left the bold, impressive lines of a
whaleback steamer loomed up, with flags on
its fore and aft masts straightened out in the
wind.</p>

<p>Presently the dull, leaden-looking water of
the Milwaukee River flashed into view. At
the East Water Street bridge its course toward
Lake Michigan changes to a southeasterly direction.
Another moment, and Tom’s eyes
were roving swiftly over the stream.</p>

<p>A pang of bitter disappointment shot
through him—the “Fearless” was not in
sight.</p>

<p>He threw out the clutch and the motor car
stopped.</p>

<p>“Stung again, maybe!” groaned the chauffeur.
He sat motionless for an instant, deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
in thought, then mumbled, “What a silly
chump I am! Come to think of it, Captain
Bunderley said ‘Near the bridge.’ I can’t do
much scouting around in this car, so I’ll shoot
it over to the nearest garage and sprint right
back.”</p>

<p>A boy, in answer to his inquiries, directed
him to cross the bridge and keep straight on
until Wisconsin Street was reached.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll find one along there,” he
said. “Say, ain’t that a whopping big machine!
How much do you get a week for
running it?”</p>

<p>“Twice as much as nothing,” answered
Tom, with a faint grin.</p>

<p>As soon as the bridge settled back into place
the motor car was put in motion. Tom directed
his course along East Water Street,
driving with great caution, until he reached
an important business section. Not far from
Wisconsin Street he found a garage and left his
machine.</p>

<p>The next thing that Tom Clifton did was to
hunt up a restaurant and refresh himself with
a good meal. This acted so wonderfully upon
his spirits that he walked out on the street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
feeling renewed confidence in the correctness
of his deductions.</p>

<p>“Bet I’ll find the yacht in half an hour,”
he said to himself. “Here’s where the hunt
begins.”</p>

<p>But although Tom Clifton thoroughly explored
the river in the neighborhood of the
East Water Street bridge, the late afternoon
found him still searching, with hope gone
down to the zero point.</p>

<p>“I’ve made the circuit of the bases and
been put out at home,” he muttered. “What
do you think of that for awful luck!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>GETTING A JOB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Benjamin Rochester</span> was not the only person
in Kenosha into whose brain a germ of
suspicion concerning the boys had found
lodgment. The very dapper and polite hotel
clerk, having overheard scraps of conversation
between Dave and Victor which plainly indicated
an unusual state of affairs, set his
thoughts in motion.</p>

<p>“It did seem mighty odd to me when that
long-legged chap beat it,” he murmured, softly.
“Queer, too, that a parcel of boys should be
sporting around in a machine fit for a multi-millionaire.
I won’t say there’s anything
wrong about it, but——”</p>

<p>A step attracted his attention.</p>

<p>Dave Brandon, wearing his usual good-natured
smile, had approached the desk.</p>

<p>“I was wondering if I could be accommodated
here for a few days,” began the historian,
blandly. “You see——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>The clerk smiled affably. He also coughed
apologetically. His thoughts ran like this:
“Oh, no, my fine fellow, you can’t work any
slick scheme on us.” Then he said:</p>

<p>“Very sorry, sir, our terms are strictly cash
in advance, especially when luggage has been
taken away. Of course I don’t doubt that
you’re all right,” he added, in a tone which
expressed all the doubt in the world.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Dave.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the clerk.</p>

<p>The historian remained thoughtful for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” he said, quietly turning
away.</p>

<p>“He looks like a pretty good sort,” mused
the clerk, glancing at Dave’s retreating form.
“Still, you never can tell; usually they’re the
slickest kind.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Dave reappeared.</p>

<p>“When Victor Collins comes in will you
kindly give him this?” he said, handing the
clerk a sealed envelope.</p>

<p>Once outside, Dave, with a twinkle in his
eye, began to walk as though he had some
important mission to perform.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Well, well!” His smile broadened. “I
was certainly never placed in such a remarkable
situation before. It has an element of
grim humor in it, too. But for this hungry
feeling I’d laugh out loud. Stranded!
Think of the fearfulness of it! Actually
stranded!”</p>

<p>Dave’s reflections, however, did not drive
away his cheerful expression.</p>

<p>“Now that the chaps have disappeared,” he
mused, “their kindly support must needs be
withdrawn. Here I am, left high and dry on
the shores of adversity, with two awful alternatives
facing me: to borrow, or not to borrow;
to depend upon myself, or not to depend
upon myself.”</p>

<p>The humor of it all appealed irresistibly to
the historian; he laughed to himself, although
his eyes were turned longingly toward a restaurant
in the window of which a tempting
collection of food products was displayed.</p>

<p>“There’s no telling how or when we fellows
will get together again,” mused Dave. “Something
has to be done quickly. I believe I’ve
struck the best plan. Anyway, it won’t do
any harm to try it. Although”—he laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
aloud—“I reckon little Vic will be considerably
surprised—even shocked.”</p>

<p>Dave had completely thrown off his usually
languid air. He walked briskly, with a certain
look in his eye which his chums would
have known meant a determination not to be
swerved.</p>

<p>He slackened his rapid pace only when a
group of circus tents finally appeared in view.
A few minutes later he crossed the lot, directing
his steps toward the mess tent.</p>

<p>He found it crowded with men and women
seated before rough board tables. A savory
odor filling the enclosure made Dave sniff the
air with keen relish. It also served to increase
his tremendous desire for a good square meal.</p>

<p>Several waiters in white caps and aprons,
balancing trays, hustled along the narrow
aisles. A constant rattle of dishes and the
jingle of knives and forks mingled in with
the buzz of conversation. Sometimes a bawling
voice sharply punctuated this medley of
sound, and now one close at hand suddenly
roared out:</p>

<p>“Hey! Watcher want?”</p>

<p>Dave looked around, to find himself the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
target for many pairs of staring eyes. It was
a little embarrassing—very little, however.
He looked over the rows of grinning faces and
was about to reply when a boy not far off suddenly
popped up from his seat.</p>

<p>“Well, if it ain’t Jumbo ag’in!”</p>

<p>A roar of mirth echoed through the mess
tent. Sallies began flying thick and fast.
Dave, however, stood his ground.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for Mr. Whiffin,” he said,
calmly.</p>

<p>Joe Rodgers, arrayed in the reddest of red
vests, put his small form in motion, and, with
remarkable disregard for the feet and shins
about him, pushed his way forward.</p>

<p>“Hey!” screeched Joe, shaking his fist at
a particularly loud-voiced person who was
busy hurling questions at Dave. “Let that
’ere feller alone. I’m his guardeen.”</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Whiffin, Joe?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“I dunno. But if ye hear a row goin’ on
anywheres steer fur it, an’ you’ll find him,”
answered Joe. “What d’ye want with ’im,
anyway?”</p>

<p>Dave, uttering a sigh of relief, withdrew
from the curious stares, the loud voices and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
general noise and confusion which pervaded
the tent. Joe was at his side.</p>

<p>“What d’ye want with Whiffin, Jumbo?”
he repeated.</p>

<p>“Joe,” remarked Dave—he placed his hand
on the lad’s broad shoulder—“if you don’t
mind, I’d rather you’d call me Dave—Dave
Brandon’s my name.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll call you Dave Jumbo,”
said Joe, gravely.</p>

<p>The historian burst into a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“Dave Jumbo?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m wise to what ye wants, Dave.”
Joe stared earnestly into the other’s face for
an instant. “Ye’re a good feller, all right—I
kin see that,” he exclaimed. “Say,—what’s
became o’ the little grouch?”</p>

<p>Dave explained.</p>

<p>“Gone off for to eat, eh? Well, did ye take
sich a fancy to Whiffin ye couldn’t stay away
from the show, eh?”</p>

<p>“Joe, I’m looking for a job.”</p>

<p>Joe’s eyes bulged out with real astonishment.</p>

<p>“What—what!” he gasped. “You’re kiddin’
me, for sure.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Oh, no; I mean it, Joe.”</p>

<p>“But say, what does a feller wearin’ clothes
like them you’ve got on want with a job?”
The idea apparently staggered “Mister” Joe
Rodgers. He thrust his hands into his
trousers pockets. “Aw, git out!” he sniffed,
after a moment of deep reflection. “Ye can’t
git across with no sich stuff as that.”</p>

<p>It took Dave five minutes of valuable time
to make Joe credit the earnestness of his
intention. But once convinced, Joe immediately
became the historian’s enthusiastic
ally.</p>

<p>“But—but I don’t believe ye kin do it,”
he said, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Lead me to Whiffin, and we’ll see,”
laughed Dave.</p>

<p>After a short search they found the manager
of “Spudger’s Peerless” at the entrance
to the main tent.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded, as Dave spoke up.</p>

<p>“I understand that you need the services of
a good barker,” began Dave.</p>

<p>“What’s that to you?” demanded Peter
Whiffin, in a querulous tone, arching his eyebrows
in surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Only that I’d like to have the job myself,
sir.”</p>

<p>The manager looked at the stout boy as
though he had never heard anything quite so
strange in all his life.</p>

<p>“What?” he snarled. “You—you—get
out; go away from here a thousand miles!”</p>

<p>“Give ’im a chanc’t, Mr. Whiffin,” pleaded
Joe. “Maybe he kin make good.”</p>

<p>“Make good, nothin’!” growled the other.
“There ain’t anything to prewent your goin’.”</p>

<p>“Only a powerful disinclination to drag
myself away from Spudger’s Peerless Circus
and Menagerie,” laughed Dave. “Come now,
Mr. Whiffin”—he changed his jocular tone to
one of seriousness—“I know that a barker is
absolutely necessary to the success of your
show. As Joe says, give me a chance.”</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Whiffin seemed to hesitate. He
looked sharply at the boy; then, reaching a
sudden decision, crooked his forefinger and
turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Dave, with Joe not far behind him, followed
the manager into the menagerie tent.</p>

<p>A really delightful odor of sawdust filled
the air. Colossus, Titan and Nero stood in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
corner, restlessly swinging their trunks, while
in the open dens lined up on either side savage
animals paced ceaselessly to and fro.</p>

<p>“Now see here,” began Peter Whiffin, cocking
his head to one side and looking very
fierce indeed, “I wouldn’t listen to yer yawp
for eight seconds but for two things: first,
you’ve got the biggest nerve of any boy I ever
see; an’ second, I do need a barker. But
I’m from Missouri—if yer know what that
means.”</p>

<p>“Want to be shown, eh?” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>He stepped off a few paces, and, with a
wink at Joe, began a steady flow of eloquence,
describing Spudger’s great show in the highly
imaginative language of a press agent.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard worse,” commented Peter
Whiffin, grudgingly, attempting to hide his
satisfaction. “Give us another round.”</p>

<p>An expression of surprise on the manager’s
face gradually deepened. Dave, thoroughly
imbued with the humorous side of the proceeding,
and determined to do himself credit,
had managed to cast aside all feelings of embarrassment.
He raised his voice until its strong,
clear notes fairly rang through the tent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“But did ye ever speak before a mob?”</p>

<p>“I’ve recited in school many times,” answered
Dave.</p>

<p>“Well, this job ain’t like speakin’ to a lot
o’ kids, mind yer,” warned Mr. Whiffin. “I
reckon you’ll feel like takin’ to the tall timber
when ye faces a real crowd.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk it,” said Dave, in a confident
manner.</p>

<p>“An’ I’m game enough to take a chance on
ye.” Peter Whiffin cast an angry look toward
Joe Rodgers, whose joy at the decision seemed
altogether out of proportion to its importance.
“Ye kin try it this afternoon. But ye’ll need
to git the biggest kind o’ a hustle on ye; the
show’s goin’ to start mighty soon.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Whiffin. What’s the pay?”</p>

<p>“For this afternoon an’ to-night two dollars
an’ grub, in case ye make good.”</p>

<p>Whiffin led the way to the entrance, and, as
they walked outside, Dave’s eyes ran over the
lot. A large number of grown people, as well
as children were headed toward it. He saw
that haste was, indeed, necessary.</p>

<p>“I’ll skip over to the mess tent now,” he
said, briskly, “and——”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“What! Ye ain’t had no grub yit?” exclaimed
Mr. Peter Whiffin, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“No! But——”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t waste your time in jawin’.
Take ’im over, you Joe. Then git right back
on the job, or you’ll hear somethin’ ye don’t
like. Report to me in fifteen minutes, young
feller.”</p>

<p>“That’s Whiffin,” growled Joe, as the two
promptly walked away. “Him an’ me don’t
hit it nohow. Say, Jumbo—I mean Dave—you’ve
got nerve, all right. If ye kin chuck
the talk to the crowd as well as ye did afore
Whiffin you’ll have Jack Gray a-guessin’.”</p>

<p>The mess tent was almost deserted when
Dave, escorted by Joe Rodgers, to the amazement
of several waiters, a clown, and a few
members of the “Celebrated Randolpho
family,” wizards of the flying trapeze, walked
up to a table and sat down.</p>

<p>“What ees this?” murmured Randolpho,
Senior, who, however, was no relation to the
other “Randolphos.” “Aha, it ees the same
fat boy I have see here before.”</p>

<p>Joe Rodgers immediately made Mr. Whiffin’s
orders known to those in charge, and in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
minutes the historian was served by a grinning
and much mystified waiter.</p>

<p>It is very likely that Victor Collins’ fastidious
tastes would have caused him to sniff at
the circus fare, but Dave had roughed it too
long in the open to be over-particular. So he
began to eat with a heartiness that increased
the grin on the waiter’s face.</p>

<p>“Ah,” murmured Dave, a short time later,
“depending upon one’s self is the real thing,
after all.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>THE NEW BARKER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Yes</span>, monsieur, I have, what you call it,
voyaged much.” Randolpho, Senior, whose
curiosity was too strong for him to resist, had
taken a place by Dave Brandon’s side. “You
have of the Cirque d’Hiver in Paree heard,
no doubt, monsieur?”</p>

<p>Dave nodded. “Winter Circus, we say in
English,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have performed there before crowds
enormous.”</p>

<p>“Do you like this country?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>Monsieur Randolpho’s agreeable voice was
silent as he pondered over the question.
Presently he said:</p>

<p>“Ah, it ees a great place—such wonderful
peoples. Nozzing for them is too hard. You
have never bark before, and yet—ah, you
go?”</p>

<p>Dave had hastily arisen.</p>

<p>“I’d like to continue the conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Monsieur Randolpho,” he remarked, pleasantly,
“but I haven’t an instant to lose.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you must of the show something learn,
ees that not it? Well, I wish you a grand
success.”</p>

<p>As Dave started off in search of Mr. Whiffin
a rather curious sensation began stealing over
him. The lot had assumed an appearance of
life and gaiety such as it had perhaps never
known before in all its existence. The insistent
cries of peanut, pretzel and lemonade
venders, the shrill yells of children, the rough
voices of men calling to one another and the
awesome snarls and growls which occasionally
came from the menagerie tent kept up a never-ceasing
din.</p>

<p>And but a short time before Dave had been
merely an outsider; but now—that meal sealed
the contract—he was to be until night a part
and parcel of “Spudger’s Peerless” and something
destined to belong to the public gaze.
The barker’s stand before the main entrance
seemed to assume an importance altogether
unwarranted by either its size or gaudily
decorated surface.</p>

<p>One quick glance disclosed Mr. Whiffin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
not far away, gesticulating, his thin, harsh
voice raised to a pitch of unpleasant shrillness.</p>

<p>“Hey, you,” he yelled, on catching sight of
Dave, “step a step this way. I’m a-waitin’.”</p>

<p>As the newly-engaged barker approached,
he saw a much-bewhiskered gentleman, florid
of complexion, apparently short of breath, and
very wide of girth sticking close to the
manager’s side.</p>

<p>“Here’s the fellow, Mr. Spudger,” exclaimed
Peter Whiffin, pointing a bony forefinger
toward the oncoming Dave. “Says he
kin help us out, but I ain’t bankin’ on it.”</p>

<p>The “great and only” Ollie Spudger unbent
his ponderous form and began to examine
Dave as a connoisseur might search for the
good points of a rare piece of statuary.</p>

<p>“Him?—He don’t look the part to me,
Whiffin,” he said, with refreshing candor.</p>

<p>“His loss if he ain’t there with the goods,”
commented Peter, shortly. “Listen, young
feller; here’s what I want ye to git over to the
audience, an’ git it over strong, mind ye.”</p>

<p>Talking rapidly, he checked off on his fingers
point after point, while Mr. Spudger nodded
his head in unison with the motions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“I understand,” said Dave. His eyes traveled
mechanically in the direction of the
stand. “Shall I begin now?”</p>

<p>“No! Come this way.”</p>

<p>The historian followed the circus men inside
the menagerie tent, where he discovered
that a space between two cages had been inclosed
by a long strip of canvas.</p>

<p>Whiffin drew aside the flap and bade him
enter.</p>

<p>Dave’s eyes immediately took in a pile of
garments resting on a stool.</p>

<p>Peter Whiffin selected a very red coat, plentifully
supplied with spangles, and, as he held
it at arm’s length, the slightest movement
sent them shaking and glittering in the dull
gray light which came from above.</p>

<p>“A fine piece of goods,” said Mr. Whiffin,
admiringly. “Slide inside, young feller.”</p>

<p>“What!” gasped Dave.</p>

<p>“Put it on,” ordered Whiffin, peremptorily.</p>

<p>The stout boy, with a broad grin, took off
his coat and made an effort to follow instructions.
It required the services of both Spudger
and Whiffin, however, to force the garment
around his ample shoulders, and during this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
operation every seam, in turn, seemed ready
to burst in angry protest.</p>

<p>“Now ye look a bit better,” exclaimed Mr.
Spudger, at length, as, somewhat winded with
his exertions, he stood off to stare at Dave
with an eye of approval.</p>

<p>“Stick this top-piece on yer, young feller,”
came from Peter Whiffin.</p>

<p>He handed over a little red cap with still
redder tassels on the sides.</p>

<p>“I certainly got myself into something
when I took this job,” laughed Dave, carefully
adjusting the head-gear. “What else do
I have to change, Mr. Whiffin?”</p>

<p>“Your expression—that’s all,” growled
Peter. “I’m goin’. Jist wait around the
tent somewheres until the ‘Ten Thousand
Dollar’ band reels off a few tunes; an’ when
I flash the signal git your nerves together an’
come.”</p>

<p>“An’ don’t let any bunch o’ kids rattle
you,” advised Mr. Spudger, following his
manager with ponderous steps.</p>

<p>Left alone, Dave paid no attention to the
men passing to and fro, but set his thoughts
busily to work on the composition of his announcement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Then, suddenly, noticing a
small, round hole in the canvas he walked
quickly toward it. In another moment his
eye was applied to the aperture.</p>

<p>He could see a considerable number of
people crowding before the entrance and also
“Spudger’s Ten Thousand Dollar Peerless
Band” occupying a raised platform near the
barker’s seat.</p>

<p>Even quiet, self-contained Dave felt his
nerves tingling curiously. The ordeal of
waiting tried his patience. He felt that his
throat, for some reason or other, was becoming
unpleasantly husky.</p>

<p>And now, after much preliminary tooting,
the band struck up. A grand crash was followed
by several resounding bangs; then the
musicians were safely off. The brass easily
predominated, almost drowning the well-meaning
attempts of the others.</p>

<p>“When we started on that motor car trip
how little I ever expected to run into anything
like this,” murmured Dave, softly. “I
certainly do wonder where those boys could
have gone.”</p>

<p>“Hey there!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>He recognized the rasping voice.</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>The great moment had arrived.</p>

<p>A strong effort stilled the quick beating of
his heart. Walking with a firm step he
reached Mr. Whiffin’s side.</p>

<p>“Up with ye! An’ chuck it over strong,
now!” commanded the manager.</p>

<p>The chilly wind blowing hard across the
lots swayed the great canvas paintings before
the entrance and violently fluttered a multitude
of flags and pennants floating from the
top of ridge poles and strung along various
ropes.</p>

<p>Even above the vigorous strains of music,
Dave could hear a curious murmur run
through the crowd as he stepped upon the
stand. In an instant every eye was apparently
focused upon him. He found it rather
difficult to face unconcernedly that battery of
looks expressive of curiosity, anticipation, or,
perhaps, dreadful to think of, derision.</p>

<p>Almost mechanically the new barker observed
the shifting currents of humanity, one
moment massed together, and the next flowing
over the lot to form in scattered groups<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
before various points of interest. It was very
picturesque and interesting. Many girls, in
their bright-colored dresses, added a touch
of color to the scene.</p>

<p>Dave became so absorbed in contemplating
the kaleidoscopic effects that he almost forgot
to feel embarrassed. But a shrill screech coming
from a youthful throat just below brought
him abruptly back to the prominence of his
position.</p>

<p>“Say somethin’ or git the hook!”</p>

<p>And just then Mr. Ollie Spudger, by a wave
of his big right hand, signaled to the fiddling
leader of the “Ten Thousand Dollar” band.</p>

<p>With another terrifying crash and bang, the
playing suddenly stopped. A stillness, appalling
by contrast, immediately seemed to
hover over the surroundings. Dave, momentarily
off his guard, found his wits acting
in a way that wits sometimes do when called
upon to perform their duties under extraordinary
conditions. Words which just a few
seconds before were clearly imprinted on his
mental vision had completely vanished, and
he stood gazing awkwardly into the faces of a
staring, noisy mob.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Below and at his back, he was conscious of
the presence of Mr. Spudger and his manager,
realizing, too, that the eyes of each were fastened
upon him with eager intensity.</p>

<p>That instant of silence was unendurable.
But a noise producer was at hand. A large
disc of metal hung between two supports on
his right, while a wooden mallet lay on a
shelf close by.</p>

<p>Dave got into action.</p>

<p>Bang, bang! A series of deafening crashes,
rivaling in volume those produced by the
brass in the “Ten Thousand,” immediately
swung off into space. Again and again the
clanging notes swelled into a din of uproarious
proportions.</p>

<p>Every straggler, apparently, within hearing
distance came rushing up, until a dense crowd
had massed itself before him.</p>

<p>Dave was once more in full control of his
faculties. Words began popping into his head
in such generous numbers that before the
notes of the gong had ceased their musical
reverberations he was addressing his audience.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, in a
clear, resonant voice, “it is my pleasure and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
privilege to call your attention to the great
and mar-velous features of Spudger’s Great
Combined Peerless Circus and Menagerie.
We have here to-day a stupendous and superb
ag-gre-gation of wonders collected from all
quarters of the globe by Mr. Ollie Spudger.
The expense was e-normous.</p>

<p>“At each and every performance there is to
be seen a grand exhibition of a-renic pomp
and splendor, together with visions of inspiring
beauty. Golden chariots drawn by huge
African elephants form part of a glittering,
jeweled and costumed army rivaling those
gorgeous pro-cessions which, centuries ago,
filed with majestic pomp before the emperors
in the Coliseum of ancient Rome.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you! That’s going some!”
screeched the voice of “Mister” Joe Rodgers
from the front row.</p>

<p>Dave hit the gong a resounding crack.</p>

<p>“I call attention to Ormond de Sylveste!”
he cried, “the champion bareback rider of
the world, in his thrilling exhibition of equestrian
skill; to Tobanus, the renowned sword
swallower, in a mysterious and a-mazing act.
And besides these two un-equaled stars there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
is the Randolpho troupe of acrobats, who, in
an as-ton-ishing series of gyrations, set at defiance
all laws of gravitation.”</p>

<p>Dave paused impressively, letting his
pointer come to rest on the broad chest of
Adolphus’ counterfeit presentment.</p>

<p>“Then there are other attractions alone
worth double the price of admission. This
most ex-tra-ordinary giant, Adolphus, is a
youth, still growing, and promising to eclipse
in height all giants of any era. Zingar, the
famous dwarf, has caused the greatest sensation
wherever shown. Mr. Ollie Spudger’s
standing offer of ten thousand dollars for his
equal in any country has never been taken up.”</p>

<p>A buzz of comments arose. Dave waited
for a few moments, then resumed:</p>

<p>“The menagerie is an exhibition in itself—a
great collection of savage, fear-in-spir-ing
animals, in gilded lairs, bringing to your very
doors the inhabitants of the jungle—an ag-gre-gation
of fe-rocious quadrupeds without
parallel in the country.</p>

<p>“And all this can be seen for the small sum
of ten cents, just one dime, an amount well
within the means of every man, woman or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
child of Kenosha. Remember—ten cents—just
one dime, to see all the curiosities. Reserved
seats up to twenty-five cents. Pass
along—get your tickets—get your tickets!”</p>

<p>Dave vigorously hammered the gong.
Then the “Ten Thousand Dollars,” obeying
another signal from Mr. Spudger, sent up a
blast that threatened the safety of ear-drums.</p>

<p>Joe Rodgers, with a shrill “Gee, this must
be a bully show, fellers!” flung over his
shoulder, made a dive for the ticket wagon,
followed by several young men whom Dave
had noticed about the circus.</p>

<p>As though they possessed some strange
magnetic force, many spectators seemed to be
drawn irresistibly after them. The tent soon
began swallowing up a steady flow of humanity,
and when interest waned Dave promptly
resumed his speaking.</p>

<p>He rose to greater heights this time, his
clear, strong voice compelling attention. He
told of the wonderful performing elephants;
of Mademoiselle Hazel, queen of the slack
wire, in her great danger-defying act, and of
Professor Lopus and his extraordinary troupe
of trained horses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Joe and his associates were on hand, and, as
before, at the important moment, started a
stampede toward the “box office.”</p>

<p>Another repetition of the performance left
standing at the entrance only a few disconsolate-looking
people. Even Mr. Peter Whiffin
could not altogether conceal his satisfaction at
the success of Spudger’s new barker.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>UNDER THE BIG TOP</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What’s</span> that you say—a note for me?”
queried Victor Collins.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” The dapper hotel clerk laid a
rather undue emphasis on the word “Sir.”—“Here
it is.”</p>

<p>Victor took the envelope, studied the inscription,
then held it up to the light, and, as
all these proceedings gave him no clue as to
the contents, he presently tore it open.</p>

<p>“I wonder what this means,” he murmured.
“Gee; the big boob!” he exclaimed, half-aloud,
an instant later. “Now what do you
know about that?”</p>

<p>“No bad news, I hope?” ventured the inquisitive
clerk.</p>

<p>“Nothing that will get in the papers, I
guess,” growled Victor, as he began to read
these lines a second time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Vic</span>:—</p>

<p>“Desperate cases require desperate remedies.
The absent food treatment does not suit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
my particular constitution. Really, I feel
hungry enough to eat brass tacks.</p>

<p>“My adventurous career seems to be not yet
over, so you will find me at ‘Spudger’s Peerless.’
Our stay in Kenosha is likely to be a
good thing for the paper industry after all.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your friend,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Dave B.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>“Well, now, I’d like to know why in thunder
he’s gone to the circus.”</p>

<p>The frown on Victor’s face deepened. With
a curt nod to the clerk he walked outside.</p>

<p>“By George, it wasn’t much advantage to
me when Blakelets steered this bunch of great
depending-upon-themselves fellows up to our
front door,” he thought, almost savagely.
“Wish he hadn’t stopped until they were a
thousand miles away. Everything has gone
wrong; dandy motor boat trip knocked in the
head, and here I am—— Oh, gee, but it does
make me tired.”</p>

<p>Then Victor stopped short, struck by a
sudden idea which made his eyes fairly flash.</p>

<p>“I do wonder, now, if this scrawl and all
that howl about being broke is just a big, silly
bluff. Maybe the Indian is taking in the
show and expects me to come chasing over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
after him. Well, I simply won’t do it—that’s
all.”</p>

<p>Victor’s jaws snapped together. Within a
few minutes his mind was made up.</p>

<p>“I’ll skip over to Uncle Ralph’s,” he muttered.
“Maybe Phil Malone is there.”</p>

<p>Captain Bunderley, being a bachelor, employed
Phil as housekeeper and general utility
man.</p>

<p>In half an hour Victor reached his uncle’s
residence, which stood back on a wide avenue.
A graveled path led across a fine lawn.
Tastefully arranged flower beds and little
cedars planted here and there gave quite an
air of elegance to the surroundings. Over the
pillared porch clinging vines swayed in the
wind, the green leaves thickly interspersed
with those of a golden and ruddy hue.</p>

<p>One glance at the tightly closed mansion
was enough to convince Victor that his
trouble had been for nothing. An air of
melancholy silence seemed to brood over the
place. Dry autumn leaves bestrewed the
porch and steps, every now and then apparently
becoming endowed with life as they
rustled away for a few feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Impatiently Victor bounded up the steps.</p>

<p>“I’ll ring, anyway,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>As the lad expected, there was no response.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” he growled. “Hasn’t
this been a real peach of a day! But I’m not
done with the Rambler Club yet.”</p>

<p>Victor didn’t enjoy himself during the rest
of the afternoon. He visited the wharf again,
only to find the “Fearless” still missing, and
finally, tired and disgusted, wandered off to
the public library.</p>

<p>The afternoon waned; then night threw
a mantle of blackness over the city. After
supper at a convenient restaurant, he decided
to take a flying look at “Spudger’s Peerless,”
then return to the hotel.</p>

<p>A bleak wind continually moaned and
howled, seizing upon the telegraph wires as
an instrument to send forth musical chords.
Many of the streets were lonely and frigidly
silent. Victor, not accustomed to being out
at night, passed shadowy, mysterious-looking
corners with a touch of fear tugging at his
heart. He was glad indeed to see a fantastic
array of lights coming into view and the
circus tents faintly luminous against the sky.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>At length he found himself among the
throngs crowding toward the barker’s stand.
And once there the lawyer’s son received the
surprise of his life. It was difficult to credit
either his eyes or ears.</p>

<p>He stopped short, to stare in utter bewilderment
at a familiar face and form.</p>

<p>“Why—why, it’s Brownie—Brownie—sure
as I live!” he gasped. “Well, by George!”</p>

<p>No words could quite express Victor Collins’
astonishment. He felt, too, a pang of
disappointment in the realization that his
plan for humbling Dave had so completely
failed. He edged his way further forward,
listening eagerly to every word of the barker’s
stirring appeal.</p>

<p>Victor had never thought that in one person
could two such different manners exist.
It was no longer the easy-going, indolent
Dave he saw before him, but a bold, fearless
lad who always had a ready retort on his
tongue for any quip hurled at him from
the audience.</p>

<p>A different feeling regarding the “Big
Indian” came into Victor’s brain in spite of
the fact that it wasn’t entirely welcome; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
saw Dave in an entirely new light. It made
him think.</p>

<p>There was too much going on all around,
however, for his present train of thought to
keep long on the track. The gasoline torches
of the barker’s stand and the lights from various
booths devoted to the purpose of supplying the
multitude with food and drink threw a strange,
fitful glare over the ever-moving crowds.</p>

<p>“Get your hot frankfurters! Peanuts,
pretzels and lemonade!” rose crisply above
the babel of sounds.</p>

<p>Amid the general noise and confusion, Victor
began to lose sight of his grievances.</p>

<p>As Dave finished his “oration,” seized the
mallet and hammered lustily on the gong,
Victor felt his heart responding so strongly to
its wild, clanging notes that the tide moving
toward the ticket wagon carried him along, a
willing victim.</p>

<p>“Hello, Brandon; hello!” he cried, eagerly.
He felt even a touch of pride in knowing
so prominent a personage. “I say, Brandon——”</p>

<p>“Have the correct change, gentlemen!
Have the correct change!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>The brusk voice of the ticket seller broke
in upon his sentence.</p>

<p>Victor, feeling himself being elbowed and
jostled aside, scarcely heard the barker’s hearty
greeting. Next instant a ticket was in his
hand, and the next after that found him passing
the portal of “Spudger’s.”</p>

<p>The sight of gilded cages with wild animals
behind the iron bars, of three huge elephants
swaying their unwieldy bodies and trunks,
of flags and bunting and numerous other
things apparently inseparable from circus life
made the frowning lines on Victor’s face entirely
disappear.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll see the show anyway,” he murmured.
“Gee, won’t it be a regular lark!”</p>

<p>Going from cage to cage he kicked up the
sawdust in pure delight. Spudger’s collection
of zoological specimens contained a lion, two
tigers, a jaguar, three pumas, a brown bear
and two coyotes. Occasionally a sullen roar
or an angry snarl seemed to indicate that
several members of the animal kingdom were
in a very uncomfortable state of mind.</p>

<p>The tent was rapidly filling up, but Victor,
having a reserved seat coupon, did not hurry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Hello, Buster!”</p>

<p>He turned quickly, to gaze into the grinning
face of “Mister” Joe Rodgers.</p>

<p>Joe looked a bit more respectable than he
had during the morning hours, but not
enough so to make the lawyer’s son feel any
great desire to continue his acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said, coldly.</p>

<p>“Say, kid, where did you drop from?”
Then, without waiting for a response, he added,
“Ain’t that big jumbo a corker—ain’t he
though? Whiffin had orter be pleased. Say,
that there feller knows every word in the
lingo, don’t he?”</p>

<p>To be addressed in such a way by a
mere water-carrier, especially before so many
people, made Victor feel highly disgusted.
With a curt nod, he turned away, and just on
the instant Joe bawled out loudly:</p>

<p>“Hey, Dave—hey! Here’s yer little Buster,
right here.”</p>

<p>Victor, intensely indignant, saw the stout
boy, who now wore his own coat, attracted by
the hail and edging his way through the
crowd toward them. Dave’s face was beaming.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Mighty glad to see you, Vic,” he exclaimed,
heartily. He held out his hand. “Can’t stay
but a minute; I’m due on the stand again.
Surprised, Vic? What did you say, Joe? A
bully spiel?—thanks!—Sir?”</p>

<p>This last word was spoken to a thin, melancholy-looking
person who had just stepped
up by the group.</p>

<p>“My hand, sir! Upon my word, I have
yet to hear the eq’al o’ what you done in the
barkin’ line to-day,” said the man, in a deep-throated
voice. “My hand, sir!”</p>

<p>Dave took it.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; it’s as far ahead of most of ’em as
my act eclipses all the rest.”</p>

<p>“So you take some part in the show, eh?”
remarked Dave, with interest. “What’s your
specialty?”</p>

<p>The other’s sad visage brightened.</p>

<p>“Spudger’s wouldn’t be much without me,”
he confided. “I’m Ormond de Sylveste.”</p>

<p>“Goodness—Ormond de Sylveste?” piped
Victor.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! An’ if anybody kin beat me
a-ridin’ I ain’t never seen ’em—fact. Whiffin
knows how waluable I am to the show. Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
I’ve had ’im so skeered thinkin’ I was about
to leave that he——”</p>

<p>“Hey there, Bill Potts, what’s the matter
with ye?” Peter Whiffin, unobserved by any
of the three, had approached, his face lined
with an astonishing number of wrinkles. “If
yer don’t git right out o’ this here tent an’
stay out, Bill Potts, I’ll dock yer for double
the time.”</p>

<p>All this was spoken in a low tone; but it
proved sufficiently strong to induce Monsieur
Ormond de Sylveste, otherwise known as Bill
Potts, to leave the spot in undignified haste.</p>

<p>“An’ it’s time for you to climb up ag’in,”
added Mr. Whiffin to Dave. “An’, as for you,
ye lazy, good-for-nuthin’ scamp”—he faced
Joe Rodgers—“beat it! Ye’d have Spudger’s
a-supportin’ ye in idleness, I reckon.”</p>

<p>With a grumble of disapprobation, Joe
obeyed, while Dave, who was also about to
leave, stopped, as Mr. Whiffin again spoke up:</p>

<p>“See here, young feller”—the manager put
on his most pleasant expression—“ye ain’t
done so bad. Here’s your money and a couple
o’ good reserved seats besides.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Dave, politely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Jack Gray ain’t got over his cold yit. I
think you’ll have to go along with the show
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Dave, a bit startled at the
prospect.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why not? You was broke, an’ I
helped ye out; don’t deny it now.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t attempt to do so, Mr. Whiffin.”</p>

<p>“You kin do me a good turn, this time.
We’re bound for Racine.”</p>

<p>Dave looked at Victor. He felt the responsibility
for his welfare which had been thrust
upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I can’t leave my friend, Mr. Whiffin,” he
said, slowly.</p>

<p>“Let ’im come along.”</p>

<p>“That’s the scheme,” cried Victor, quite
delighted. “Sure thing, Brandon.” The
idea of his actually traveling with a circus
took his fancy by storm. “Say yes, you big
Indian.”</p>

<p>“I knew you’d be reasonable,” exclaimed
Whiffin. “Then it’s all settled?”</p>

<p>“If Victor agrees, I suppose so,” answered
Dave. “You’re sure now, Vic?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“Good!” The manager even smiled.
“How much did you pay for your ticket,
young feller?”</p>

<p>“A quarter,” answered Victor.</p>

<p>“Here it is.” A coin was thrust into his
hand. Then Mr. Peter Whiffin exclaimed,
briefly, to Dave: “Hustle back to your job
now. I’ll see ye later.” And he was off.</p>

<p>Victor had been primed with numerous
questions to hurl at the Rambler but was
forced to wait until Dave reappeared, fifteen
minutes later, this time in his street clothes.</p>

<p>“I needn’t talk any more now,” he explained.
“Mr. Spudger says there are as
many people inside the tent as the law allows.”</p>

<p>Victor soon learned all he wished to know.
Unconsciously, his manner toward Dave had
undergone a decided change. A boy who
could calmly face an audience the way the
“Big Indian” had done was worthy of a certain
respect. An idea—but a very vague idea,
it is true—of his own limitations, of his own
shortcomings, for the first time, perhaps, stole
into his head.</p>

<p>In a small tent adjoining the menagerie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the two found that Adolphus and Zingar were
the principal attractions. They had scarcely
entered when the youthful giant recognized
them, and, disregarding all rules of professional
ethics, called loudly for both to come
over.</p>

<p>“Little Georgy” was arrayed in a gorgeous
military uniform of no known epoch, plentifully
besprinkled with gilt braid and big
shiny buttons. A sword dangled from his
side, while a hat suggestive of Napoleon’s
famous head-gear was perched on his head.</p>

<p>“Goodness! I’m glad to see you again,”
warbled the giant, in his childish treble.
“Smitty says—er—er—I mean Zingar says
Potts—er—er—I mean Ormond told him
you’d made a big hit. Ouch—look out!”</p>

<p>An inquisitive urchin, having decided in
his own mind that Adolphus was perched upon
wooden supports, had boldly, but without
malice, deliberately kicked him on the shins.</p>

<p>“S’cuse me, feller,” he said, apologetically.
“It’s all you, ain’t it? My, oh my, what a
whopper! Don’t I wisht I was you.”</p>

<p>“It’s all in the point of view,” laughed
Dave. “We’ll see you after the show,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
George. Mr. Whiffin’s close about, you know.
He might be kind of peevish if he saw us
talking together. How are you, Zingar?”</p>

<p>The dwarf stood a trifle over three feet in
height, and his diminutive person was also
arrayed in gorgeous attire. A little round
bullet head, with gray, whimsical eyes and a
laughing mouth gave him the jolliest appearance
of anybody connected with the Peerless
show. He made a peculiar little curtsey to
the boys, but, being a real professional curio
of many years’ experience, did not condescend
to speak.</p>

<p>The two soon followed the crowd into the
main tent, which presented a gala appearance.
Every available seat seemed to be taken and
at every point of vantage a few late arrivals
were standing.</p>

<p>The members of the “Ten Thousand Dollar”
now filed into their places, and a few
preliminary notes mingled in with all those
peculiar sounds which seem inseparable from
a great gathering—the swelling murmur of
many voices, the shrill screech of some bold
urchin and the monotonous chant of the peanut
and pretzel seller.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>By the time the band struck up the two
had taken their seats.</p>

<p>After three selections had been played the
crowd began to grow restive. A scattered
stamping of feet soon grew into a dull, steady
roar, until the bravest efforts of the “Ten
Thousand” were drowned in the sea of sound.</p>

<p>Suddenly the clanging note of a gong was
heard. A “grand triumphal and gorgeous
spectacle of oriental and barbaric splendor”
was about to make its entry. Gilded Roman
chariots drawn by “fiery” steeds three abreast,
followed by Colossus, Titan and Nero, each
pulling a golden car and led by gentlemen
whose skin was nicely stained came first.
Next were men in armor carrying huge shields
and spears, and over all lights flashed with
bewildering effect.</p>

<p>The great Ollie Spudger himself, astride a
coal black horse, and escorted by a cavalcade
of Arabs and Japanese—at least, they bore a
resemblance to Arabs and Japanese—bowed
with condescending grace to the multitude.</p>

<p>“Great!” laughed Victor, gleefully.</p>

<p>Act followed act. In the small sawdust
circle the celebrated Randolpho troupe of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
acrobats, as well as jugglers and clowns did
their best to amuse; and frequent manifestations
of approval came to encourage their efforts.</p>

<p>“Say, just listen to that!” cried Victor,
suddenly holding up his hand.</p>

<p>A dull moaning roar was sounding outside,
and during the lulls they could hear a patter
of rain beating against the canvas. A chilly
wind took advantage of every opening, while
the dingy canvas sides swayed back and forth
in the gusts.</p>

<p>“The storm has broken at last,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“Gee!” grunted Victor. He raised his coat
collar. “I guess we’re in for a good soaking,
Brandon.”</p>

<p>“By the time the show lets out it may have
lessened a bit,” returned Dave, encouragingly.
“Ah ha; there is our friend, at last.”</p>

<p>“Hello—Bill Potts!” quoth Victor.</p>

<p>“Hush, lad, hush,” laughed Dave. “Ormond
de Sylveste, you mean.”</p>

<p>Standing gracefully upon the back of a
white horse, the chief equestrian of Spudger’s
rode impressively into the ring. He bore no
more resemblance to the melancholy-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Bill Potts of the earlier hours than did the
bright, glistening spangles and other embellishments
of his costume to his old, discarded
clothes. Bill Potts—temporarily, at least—existed
no more; Ormond de Sylveste now
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>Crack! Crack! The sound of the ringmaster’s
whip, rising sharply above the roar
of the storm, sent the white horse into a swift
gallop around the ring. Faster—still faster,
but never too fast for the intrepid Ormond,
pounded the flying hoofs. Gracefully he
poised on one foot; with easy skill he crashed
through paper-covered hoops held up by a
powdered and painted clown, then turned
wonderful somersaults, never missing his
footing on the back of the flying steed.</p>

<p>Every known variety of sound which small
boys can produce greeted Ormond de Sylveste
as he dismounted, and, with the grace of a
dancing master, bowed his thanks.</p>

<p>Other performers appeared and went
through their turns. Mr. Ollie Spudger
made a speech, and when the show finally
ended apparently every one was satisfied with
the grand display made by the Peerless.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>The spectators had scarcely risen to their
feet when the dismantling of the seats began.
The blows of hammers, the sound of heavy
planks being taken up and piled one upon
another, the sharp commands combined with
the storm to produce a din and confusion
which made only the youthful care to linger.</p>

<p>“Guess they’re going to get ahead of the
wind and pull the old canvas down over our
ears,” said Victor. “Great Scott! Say——”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see? Why, the menagerie tent
is gone.”</p>

<p>“So it is.”</p>

<p>The brightly-lighted tent which had contained
the animals was no longer visible
through the exit, its place being taken by a
square of darkened sky.</p>

<p>The two hurried forward and found, to
their great satisfaction, that the rain had almost
ceased.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it look odd?” said Victor, glancing
around, and kicking up the sawdust with his
foot.</p>

<p>“They made a mighty quick get-away,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
commented Dave. “A busy scene out there,
Vic.”</p>

<p>By the brilliant glare of a calcium light
they could see that teams of horses had been
hitched to the great wagons. Several were
already started on their difficult journey over
the muddy field.</p>

<p>“Who’s this coming?” exclaimed Victor,
at length.</p>

<p>A figure, sometimes silhouetted sharply
against the lights, then almost lost in shadow,
was approaching on a run.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jumbo—I mean Dave,” yelled a
lusty voice. “Where are ye? Hello!”</p>

<p>“Right over here, Joe,” called the historian.</p>

<p>“Bully! Whiffin says you an’ Buster are
to go along o’ me, an’ the team’s a’ready.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>THE WHALEBACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Ralph Bunderley</span> was, frankly,
glad to see the visitors again.</p>

<p>“Come right on board, lads,” he called
from his position on the deck. “Where is
Victor? Gone off on a jaunt with that stout
boy, eh? Oh, well, it’s all right. He has
lots of time to enjoy himself before we leave.”</p>

<p>Uncle Ralph had a great deal to talk about.
His exciting sea tales found attentive listeners,
and the captain seemed equally interested in
hearing about some of the adventures of the
Rambler Club.</p>

<p>“Sorry I can’t tell you a thriller with a
trip on a motor yacht as the subject,” laughed
Bob.</p>

<p>For an instant Uncle Ralph made no reply.
Then he said, slowly:</p>

<p>“Come down in the cabin, boys. I have a
few things you may enjoy looking over.”</p>

<p>On reaching the saloon the captain walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
to a bookcase, opened it and brought out a
large album.</p>

<p>“My own snap-shots,” he explained, with a
touch of pride.</p>

<p>“Some dandy views here,” said Bob, turning
the leaves. “What! Are you going to
leave us already, captain?”</p>

<p>“Just a few minutes, Bob. When you get
through you’ll find another volume on the
shelf.”</p>

<p>Bob and Charlie soon became so deeply
absorbed in their pleasant task of following
the captain on some of his foreign voyages by
the aid of pictures that various sounds of
activity in the engine room, besides numerous
noises on deck, failed to make more than a
vague impression on their minds.</p>

<p>The sudden starting of a gasoline motor,
together with an unmistakable gliding movement
on the part of the “Fearless,” however,
caused both to look up with exclamations of
surprise.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, sugar!” exclaimed Charlie, nervously.
“What on earth does this mean, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“That we’re leaving it yards behind us, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
suppose,” chuckled Bob. “Hello, captain;
giving us a surprise, eh?”</p>

<p>Uncle Ralph was coming down the companionway.</p>

<p>“I thought you boys might like to see a
motor yacht in action,” he laughed. “Bob,
in your future accounts of adventures, you
may add a description of a short trip on Lake
Michigan.”</p>

<p>“On Lake Michigan?” gasped Charlie.</p>

<p>His face flushed slightly. Naturally he did
not wish to be thought lacking in courage,
but the prospect certainly failed to arouse his
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“That’ll be perfectly great!” cried Bob.
“Thanks, captain. We’ll enjoy it immensely.”</p>

<p>“How about the time, though?” asked
Blake, rather weakly.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” answered Uncle
Ralph, “but come up on deck.”</p>

<p>As they sat beneath the awning a constantly
changing scene of factories, of various craft,
and those picturesque jumbles of buildings
which are so often seen along water-fronts,
passed before their eyes.</p>

<p>While the “Fearless” cut swiftly through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the gray, choppy water, churning it into
creamy foam, and the wind tore past in heavy
gusts Blake’s peace of mind didn’t improve.
Presently he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll stroll around a bit,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“All right, Charlie,” said Bob.</p>

<p>The senior at the Kingswood High soon
observed Phil Malone industriously polishing
a brass rail at the bow. Phil’s manner as
he approached strongly suggested that of a
hare taken by surprise.</p>

<p>“Hello, Phil!” greeted Charlie, pleasantly.</p>

<p>The “first mate,” without stopping work,
grunted a monosyllable in reply.</p>

<p>“How’s the world treating you?”</p>

<p>Phil’s views on the subject seemed to be
rather indefinite. Blake understood, however,
that he had no general complaint to make.</p>

<p>“Say, Phil, we’re bound for the lake.
Rather dangerous out there at times, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Charlie tried to speak in a very careless tone
indeed.</p>

<p>“Yep—awful,” answered Phil, not very
reassuringly, as he kept on polishing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“But, of course, in weather like this it’s all
safe enough, eh?”</p>

<p>“A feller ain’t never safe on the water,” commented
Phil, with amazing volubility, for him.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have plenty of life preservers
on board?” said Charlie, with a forced
grin.</p>

<p>Phil thought they had.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope we shan’t need ’em.”</p>

<p>“Can’t never tell,” mumbled the “first
mate,” giving an obstinate place on the brass
an extra hard rub.</p>

<p>“Ever been in any tight fixes, Phil?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“On the lake.”</p>

<p>“In what boat?”</p>

<p>“This un.”</p>

<p>The conversation was not taking the cheery
turn for which Charlie had hoped.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll get back, Phil,” he remarked,
turning away.</p>

<p>“Not the slightest objection,” came from
Phil.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes the “Fearless” was racing
through the turbulent water of the lake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
Battery after battery of surging waves swept
against the hull, often sending showers of
shining drops spattering over the deck.</p>

<p>Gripped by the full force of wind and wave
the motor yacht began to careen. Each instant
Charlie Blake could see the city of
Kenosha becoming more and more obscured
behind the dull gray atmosphere.</p>

<p>“I call this perfectly stunning—one of the
greatest of sports!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Certainly wish I was out of it,” murmured
Charlie, steadying himself by the rail.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon leave that schooner yonder far
astern, Bob,” he heard Captain Bunderley say.</p>

<p>Bob Somers raised a pair of marine glasses,
which the skipper handed him, to his eyes.
The vessel was apparently swept across the intervening
space with lightning speed. He saw
her spread of canvas bellying out in the wind,
dingy masses of white slowly moving forth
and back against the sky. The instrument
shifted from point to point brought into view
a network of rigging, spars, cabins, several
sailors lounging near the forepeak and the
line of water breaking crisply against the
length of her hull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p174.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“STEAMER COMING,” HE ANNOUNCED</p>

<p>“She’s plowing along bravely,” said Bob,
bracing himself to resist the wind. “Hello!”
Swinging the glass toward the faint line of the
horizon, he had suddenly picked out from the
gloom a thin wisp of smoke. “Steamer coming,”
he announced.</p>

<p>“Very probably a whaleback bound for
Chicago,” explained Uncle Ralph. He smiled
quizzically. “A cat may look at the king,
they say, so we’ll make an inspection of the
monster at close range. Then we can race her
back to Kenosha. Is she in range yet, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and looks like a whopper to me.
I can see that the sides of the hull are curved
over at the top, which means it’s a whaleback,
all right.”</p>

<p>The skipper shouted several directions to
the helmsman. Martin Ricks thereupon
changed the course of the “Fearless,” heading
her directly toward the steamer, now distinctly
visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The long stretch of water which separated
them was being cut down with remarkable
rapidity. Bob Somers, his eye to the glass,
saw the three decks of the big white steamer
crowded with passengers. Moving swiftly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
through the turbulent water, apparently unaffected
by the continual onslaughts of wind
and waves, she presented a majestic appearance.</p>

<p>The powerful glass brought every detail
into view with extraordinary clearness. As
Bob slowly swept the craft from stem to stern
it seemed as though she was but a few yards
distant. For an instant his gaze rested on the
pilot house; then he lowered the glass, giving
him the range of the upper deck.</p>

<p>A man leaning over the rail near the forward
end, with a megaphone in his hand and
surrounded by a group, immediately attracted
Bob Somers’ attention. Their faces, sharply
revealed in the circle of light, were all turned
toward the motor yacht with an interest which
seemed to him unusual.</p>

<p>“Looks as though the man is going to hail
us,” he murmured.</p>

<p>He removed the glass, and, instantly, the
whaleback seemed to be shot far back on the
waste of water.</p>

<p>When the two craft were within a short distance
of each other, Captain Bunderley, considerably
surprised to notice that the steamer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
had stopped her screw, gave orders to shut off
power.</p>

<p>“The ‘Fearless’ ahoy!” yelled a voice
through the megaphone.</p>

<p>“That’s Captain Phillips,” declared Skipper
Bunderley. “A good friend of mine, too.
He wouldn’t stop out here unless he had
something important to say.” He raised his
voice in a sonorous yell. “What’s that, Phillips?”</p>

<p>“I want to ask if you can do me a great
favor?” came from the captain of the whaleback.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>AN UNEXPECTED VOYAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> minutes later, so skilfully had Martin
Ricks handled the “Fearless” that she was
bobbing up and down on the leeward side of
the monster steamer, which was still going
slowly ahead under its own momentum. Its
decks, rising high above them, and suggestive
of some great building, seemed to have the
singular effect of flattening the motor yacht
almost down to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>Hundreds of heads appeared over the rails,
and the comments which ran through the
crowd sounded above the wash and swish of
beating water.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound, Captain Bunderley?”
asked the master of the whaleback.</p>

<p>“We are just out on a pleasure jaunt and
intend to return to Kenosha at once!” yelled
Uncle Ralph.</p>

<p>“Good, Bunderley! I’m going to introduce
you to Judge Hampton, of Milwaukee.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Captain Phillips indicated a gentleman at
his side.</p>

<p>“A well-known man, too. His term of
office recently expired, but everybody still
calls him Judge,” commented the skipper,
the next instant replying in his bluff and
hearty fashion.</p>

<p>Judge Hampton, a rather elderly man, holding
his eye-glasses in one hand and a paper in
the other, looked down upon them gravely.</p>

<p>“Captain Bunderley,” he began, in much
the same tone of voice as he might have used in
charging a jury, “a wireless message has just
reached me”—he waved the paper—“stating
that my presence in Milwaukee is needed at
once. Would it be possible for you to land
me in Kenosha? The matter is of very great
importance.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I can, Judge,” responded Uncle
Ralph, politely.</p>

<p>“I shall be most heartily obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Hey, Phil Malone!” shouted Captain
Bunderley, “stand by to catch a line.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>Uncle Ralph began to issue various orders.
The bell in the engine room clanged loudly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
The motor roared for an instant, then sank
into a low, droning murmur.</p>

<p>“Mind yourself!” yelled a voice, suddenly.</p>

<p>A man on the lower deck of the whaleback
was making ready to cast a rope.</p>

<p>On it came—a sinuous, snake-like line,
hurtling straight toward Captain Bunderley,
who stood near the bow. The throw was accurate,
and, in spite of the rocking, slippery deck,
the skipper managed to catch it. In another
instant Phil Malone was grasping a second
rope hurled from a point near the motor
yacht’s stern.</p>

<p>Both lines were made fast, and the “Fearless,”
struggling like some resisting monster
against the grip of a giant foe, began closing
up the gap of water which lay between it and
the great white hull.</p>

<p>Although shielded by the towering whaleback,
the yacht wobbled and shook to such an
extent that the last particle of interest on
Charlie Blake’s part vanished. Supporting
himself with difficulty, he stood watching
Phil Malone and the captain hang out fenders.
He heard various shouts from both vessels,
the bell in the engine room of the “Fearless”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
again clanging, and the creak of straining
ropes. Then the last few feet of water was
covered and the yacht sidled up to the larger
boat with a dull, jarring shock.</p>

<p>Presently a rope ladder dangled its length
from deck to deck. Judge Hampton trusted
himself to its swaying rungs, and, with extreme
care, descended to the motor yacht.</p>

<p>“When I started out I didn’t expect to have
the honor of welcoming a former member of
Wisconsin’s judiciary on board the ‘Fearless,’”
said Captain Bunderley, assisting his passenger
to a seat.</p>

<p>“The honor is mine,” smiled the Judge.</p>

<p>The skipper and his “first mate” cast off
the lines. A great churning of water quickly
followed. A hearty farewell cheer came from
the whaleback’s deck, as the two vessels swung
clear, and the “Fearless” seemed to leap away
from the monster’s side.</p>

<p>Captain Bunderley consulted a railroad time-table.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are anxious to reach Milwaukee
as soon as possible, Judge?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am, indeed,” affirmed the passenger.</p>

<p>“Well, I find that we should arrive in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Kenosha too late for you to catch the next
express. That means an hour or more lost.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said the Judge.</p>

<p>Captain Bunderley swung around and faced
Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“If you two chaps shouldn’t turn up at the
hotel just when your chums expect, are they
the sort to raise an awful howl or sit down
and blubber?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not much,” laughed Bob. “They’ll know
it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“In that case, I’ll take you direct to Milwaukee,
Judge,” announced the skipper, suddenly,
much to Charlie Blake’s astonishment
and disgust.</p>

<p>The jurist immediately protested that he
couldn’t think of such a thing; but Uncle
Ralph, with a smile, tersely ordered the yacht’s
course to be changed.</p>

<p>“The time means practically nothing to
me, Judge, while it may be of great advantage
to you,” he said.</p>

<p>The “Fearless” was pitching heavily.
Charlie Blake looked at the succession of
waves following each other ceaselessly across
the broad expanse, at whitecaps always forming,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
and at others always on the point of dissolving
themselves back into the gray, somber
element. The heaving, tumbling flood and
the dark, ragged storm-clouds scudding low,
apparently dipping down at the blurred horizon
line to meet the water, made an impressive
spectacle. But certain distressing symptoms
prevented Blake from thoroughly
enjoying it.</p>

<p>He determined, however, not to let Bob
Somers see how badly he was affected. “He’ll
think I’m a quitter,” he mused.</p>

<p>His mind fully occupied, Blake only heard
the conversation going on around him as a
confused jumble of words.</p>

<p>“I do wonder how long it will be before we
get there?” he murmured, impatiently.</p>

<p>Time, to him at least, seemed to drag out
interminably. But, at length, to his great
joy, Uncle Ralph spoke up.</p>

<p>“The lighthouse at the entrance to the
harbor of Milwaukee, boys,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” came from Charlie
Blake. Then, sotto voce, he added, “No
more motor yacht motoring for me.”</p>

<p>The “Fearless,” apparently racing at almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
the speed of a railroad train, had brought into
view what appeared to be but a small gray
vertical streak. The four watched it and a
confused blur of lights and darks on the distant
shore slowly shaping themselves into
definite form.</p>

<p>Finally, towers, domes and chimneys
sprang out from the shadowy masses, to
form gray silhouettes against the sky. Before
long the largest city in Wisconsin was clearly
revealed to the gaze of the interested boys.</p>

<p>The motor yacht soon swung abreast of the
lighthouse, and, at length, glided smoothly
into the picturesque Milwaukee River, where
a variety of interesting sights began to pass
in a steadily-moving procession.</p>

<p>A bridge opened to let them by, then another.
Near the third, which Captain Bunderley
explained was the East Water Street
bridge, he pointed out a landing.</p>

<p>“There’s where I usually moor the ‘Fearless,’”
he said.</p>

<p>“Why not follow your general custom
now?” asked the Judge.</p>

<p>“For two reasons,” answered the captain:
“your office is considerably further in town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and the boys will have an opportunity to see
more of the water-front.”</p>

<p>“Objection sustained,” laughed Judge
Hampton, “with my thanks added.”</p>

<p>At the Grand Avenue bridge a small
steamer, coming from the opposite direction,
held the motor yacht up for a few moments.</p>

<p>Great warehouses, with long rows of staring
windows and having only a narrow footway
between them and the water, lifted their time-stained
walls grimly against the clouds. The
river, hemmed in on every hand, assumed a
peculiar appearance of narrowness, which to
the boys was heightened by contrast with the
broad open lake so recently left behind. To
their right a great modern structure surmounted
by a tower was surrounded by
buildings of all heights and sizes, the old and
new standing side by side. Still further beyond,
another towered structure, the city hall,
rose high in the air.</p>

<p>“But for the character of the buildings this
view might suggest a bit of Holland,” remarked
Captain Bunderley.</p>

<p>Other bridges were passed. Finally, beyond
a bend in the river, the skipper gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
orders to bring the yacht up alongside a
wharf. This was done in an orderly fashion,
and within a few moments she was made fast.</p>

<p>“We’re here, and here we stay,” said Captain
Bunderley. “No East Water Street bridge
for the ‘Fearless’ to-day, boys.”</p>

<p>The Judge shook hands warmly with the
three and gave the captain his card.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that I’m ready to return the
favor at any time,” he said, cordially. “This
applies to all of you. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>They watched the tall, dignified Judge until
his figure had disappeared behind a building.</p>

<p>“Judges can be mighty nice, after all,”
thought Charlie. “Still, I’d a heap rather
meet this particular one off the bench than
on.”</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” spoke up Uncle Ralph, “a
telegram must be sent to your stout friend
Brandon announcing our safe arrival. Tell
Victor to take a room at the hotel and expect
me back to-morrow. Now, we’re thirty odd
miles from your motor car. Going with me
in the morning, or will——”</p>

<p>“Not for mine,” declared the “grind,” decidedly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Either Dave or Tom can drive the car,”
said Bob. “So we’ll let ’em come to us.”</p>

<p>“Very good.”</p>

<p>The hotel and restaurant which Uncle Ralph
generally patronized on his visits to the city
was some distance from the wharf. As no
telegraph office was passed on the way they
concluded to defer sending the missive to Dave
until after their meal. And this took considerable
time.</p>

<p>But the telegram was finally flashed over
the wires with the request that Dave should
send an immediate response. Then nothing
remained but to see the sights and amuse
themselves.</p>

<p>Captain Bunderley, after exacting a promise
that they would meet him at the hotel about
six o’clock, returned to the yacht.</p>

<p>After they had wandered about the busy
streets for some time Charlie exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Now, what’s the program? My legs are
beginning to put up a kick.”</p>

<p>“We are right close to that East Water
Street bridge,” said Bob, as he consulted a
pocket map. “Looked like an interesting
section to me. Suppose we take it in?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“One way is about as good as another, I
s’pose,” replied Charlie, wearily.</p>

<p>As the two came in sight of the bridge a tall,
thin boy standing near a little building at one
end attracted Blake’s attention.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he exclaimed, “I never expected
to see another chap in this part of the
country with a shape just like Tom’s! What’s
the matter, Bob?”</p>

<p>Bob Somers’ expression had undergone such
a sudden and startling change that Charlie
repeated his inquiry with a rising inflection.</p>

<p>“Don’t you recognize him?” demanded
Bob, sharply.</p>

<p>“Recognize who?”</p>

<p>“Why, Tom—our Tom Clifton, of course!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>TOM SCORES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, sugar! You’re dreaming. Pinch
yourself,” cried Charlie Blake. “Tom is miles
from here; he’s away back in Kenosha, you
silly goose.”</p>

<p>“He was, but he isn’t; he’s right there in
front of us.”</p>

<p>The “grind” gazed first at the tall boy,
whose back was partly turned, then toward
his friend with such an air of comical bewilderment
that at any other time Bob Somers
would have burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“It—it—certainly does look like Tom, but—but—why,
hang it all, how can it be Tom?”
he gasped.</p>

<p>Bob Somers smiled, and the next instant
Blake heard him utter a lusty call which
strangely resembled the hoot of an owl.</p>

<p>It produced a most extraordinary effect on
the tall lad. He swung around as sharply as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
though struck by some flying object. Then
Charlie heard an answering hail of a similar
character, and, at the same moment, saw the
lad start toward them on a loping trot.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! It is—it actually is Tom
Clifton!” he cried. “Well, well!”</p>

<p>On came the tall boy, while Bob Somers
and his companion, perhaps more astonished
than they had ever been in all their lives,
walked rapidly to meet him.</p>

<p>Tom Clifton’s face, as he approached, presented
a most curious study. He made a
desperate attempt to appear cool and dignified,
but, in spite of all his efforts, conflicting feelings
of joy, triumph, and even indignation
persisted in finding reflection on his countenance.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, I knew I’d see you!” was his
exclamation, as he seized the other’s hand.
“That was a pretty slick scheme of Vic’s,
but——”</p>

<p>“Slick scheme?” gasped Bob, while Charlie
Blake’s mouth flew wide open.</p>

<p>“Sure thing! Oh, you needn’t try to
put on any nice innocent looks.” Tom assumed
an air of pitying condescension. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
got wise to your dodge, all right; yes siree,
Bob Somers. Ha, ha! You chaps didn’t get
up quite early enough to fool little Tom.”</p>

<p>“Why—why—what do you mean?” cried
Bob. “How in thunder did you get here,
and why?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a good one!” exclaimed Tom,
indignation suddenly getting the upper hand of
his other emotions. “Say, do you chaps see
anything green in me—ah, do you now?”
A scornful look flashed in his eyes. “Little
Vic’s keeping out of sight, I suppose, eh?
Thinks I might hurt him. But—but—honest,
Bob, I didn’t think it of you!” he blurted out,
unable to control his feelings any longer.
“Honest, I didn’t!”</p>

<p>“What does all this mean, Tom?” demanded
Bob, sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, now, cut it out, I tell you. I don’t
mind a joke——”</p>

<p>“A joke?” broke in the highly mystified
Blake.</p>

<p>“Yes; a joke! You understand English,
I s’pose?”</p>

<p>“No; not this new brand of yours,” murmured
Charlie.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“See here, Tom”—Bob Somers laid a hand
on the other’s shoulder—“let’s get at this
thing. How did you come here?”</p>

<p>“In the motor car, of course.”</p>

<p>“And where are Dave and Victor?”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Bob,” cried Tom, hotly,
“you and Charlie know—I don’t. They
helped you pull off this little trick and——”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar! What kind of a mix-up is
this?” cried Bob, a glimmer of the true state
of affairs entering his brain at last. “So you
came here alone?”</p>

<p>“A constable was in the car part way,” said
Tom, loftily. “I let ’er out a bit, Bob. And
talk ’bout whizzing! Why, all the telegraph
poles seemed to be melted into one—honest
fact, they did. Now tell me what has become
of Dave?”</p>

<p>“If Dave isn’t with you, he and Victor
must be thirty-four miles from here,” said
Bob, calmly.</p>

<p>“What?” piped the tall lad, a sinking feeling
suddenly gripping his heart. Bob Somers’
expression was quite enough to convince
him of his sincerity. “Dave and Victor in
Kenosha!” he added, faintly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>His thoughts ran riot for a moment. Then,
after all, Victor Collins wasn’t responsible.
It really came as a stunning surprise to Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, the jinx has surely got us on
this trip,” he exclaimed. “Say, fellows, that
was a foul tip of mine.”</p>

<p>Highly disgusted, Tom Clifton told the
whole story, not forgetting, even in his mental
stress, to take credit for the fact that his calculations
regarding the destination of the
motor yacht had proven correct.</p>

<p>The “grind” was not demonstrative, as a
rule, but on this occasion he fairly roared
with mirth, slapped his knees and grew
so red in the face that Tom became quite
alarmed.</p>

<p>“Gee! Look out, Charlie,” he cautioned.
“The system can stand only so much.”</p>

<p>“I know; and this was just a trifle over
the limit,” gurgled Blake. “Ha, ha, Tom!
You have Sherlock Holmes beaten a mile.”</p>

<p>Tom was highly aggrieved.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave it to Bob if anybody wouldn’t
have been liable to think as I did,” he declared,
stoutly. “Now tell me how it happened
that you’re here.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>When Tom had been duly informed, Bob
Somers remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, fellows, this certainly puts a new
aspect on the case. What’s to be done? Dave
and Vic’ll think we’ve deserted ’em, sure.
Another thing: Dave didn’t have a cent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Charlie. “Victor
always carries nearly a ton of the stuff in
his pockets.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he wouldn’t lend Dave a nickel,”
put in Tom, charitably. “Looked to me as
if he has it in for us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out,” scoffed Blake.</p>

<p>“Get off, you mean—eh, Bob?”</p>

<p>“We’ll most likely find a telegram waiting
for us at the hotel,” said Bob, shaking his head
negatively at Tom’s suggestion.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see.”</p>

<p>There was so much of interest in the streets
that the boys didn’t feel inclined to hurry
themselves. So it was late in afternoon when
they finally set out in search of the hotel
which Captain Bunderley patronized.</p>

<p>By the time they reached it street lights
and show windows were gleaming brightly
through the darkness of a very dark night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>The boys found Uncle Ralph in the reception
room.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no telegram from your friend
yet,” was his greeting as they stepped toward
him. When his eyes lighted upon Tom Clifton’s
tall figure he half arose in his chair.
“’Pon my word—what on earth does this
mean?” he exclaimed. “Where did you
come from, boy?”</p>

<p>Tom was visibly embarrassed, as the eyes
of every one in the room were immediately
leveled upon him.</p>

<p>“I blew in on the motor car,” he began,
“and——”</p>

<p>“What—on the motor car—alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and——”</p>

<p>“Let’s have this story right from the beginning,”
thundered Uncle Ralph, bringing his
fist down on the table with a resounding
bang, a proceeding which added considerably
to Tom’s confusion.</p>

<p>It wasn’t very easy for the tall boy to relate
his story, especially with a number of people
sitting around, all apparently eager to hear
him speak. Uncle Ralph’s loud voice was
the cause of this. He plunged in bravely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
however, being very careful indeed not to
let out a hint regarding Victor’s supposed
trick.</p>

<p>Many and varied were Captain Bunderley’s
observations as the tale was told. The captain
couldn’t help expressing his frank opinion at
all times, and in this case it wasn’t favorable
to Tom.</p>

<p>“Why on earth did you do such a silly
thing, boy?” he stormed.</p>

<p>“Silly?” cried Tom, aghast.</p>

<p>“Certainly; absolutely so.”</p>

<p>Tom, in helpless confusion, looked from
Bob to Charlie.</p>

<p>“Silly?” he repeated, in fainter accents.</p>

<p>His face flushed a deep crimson. Then,
suddenly, all the fire in his nature flashed
into a flame of burning indignation.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a bit silly, sir,” he declared,
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Now just see here, young chap”—the
captain’s big finger waved before Tom’s eyes;
his voice boomed through the room with
appalling distinctness—“it was silly! What
will Victor and Dave think when they find
you and the motor car missing?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“I—I—don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t. But just imagine
how worried those two boys may be.”</p>

<p>“Victor—perhaps; not Dave, sir. Besides,
it isn’t my fault.”</p>

<p>“Not your fault?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. But for your running off with
Bob and Charlie it never would have happened.”</p>

<p>Tom came perilously near wilting under
the captain’s stern gaze; only by a desperate
effort could he control his shaky nerves.</p>

<p>The lines on the skipper’s face softened; the
harsh look faded from his eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s true, my boy,” he said, reflectively;
“quite true! Shake hands and forget what
I said. But the mischief must be undone at
once. Bob, I’m going to call up the hotel at
Kenosha by long distance ’phone. My sister,
if she knew the situation, I am sure would be
intensely worried about the boy.”</p>

<p>The three followed the captain’s burly form
into the office.</p>

<p>Tom’s expression had undergone a most
remarkable change; his face now wore a look
of conscious triumph.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“I squelched him some—eh, Bob?” he
whispered in scarcely audible tones. “He
couldn’t make me the goat, oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Be with you in a moment,” bawled out
the captain, entering a telephone booth.</p>

<p>Little things like a closed door and a pile
of boards couldn’t keep Uncle Ralph’s voice
within bounds. Presently they heard him
say: “What! Couldn’t give ’em the telegram
because they’ve gone? How’s that?—When?
’Pon my word! And left no message, either?
Don’t expect ’em back? Why not?”</p>

<p>The answer was evidently far from satisfactory,
for, with a sharp “I’ll call you up
later,” Captain Bunderley flipped the receiver
back into place and stalked outside.</p>

<p>“Neither of ’em is at the hotel,” he exclaimed.
“The clerk says they went off at
different times. Victor finally came back, but
left again. Says the stout boy asked for credit,
but he was obliged to refuse.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Then he promptly explained Dave’s situation,
while Uncle Ralph’s brow clouded over.</p>

<p>“A very annoying state of affairs, indeed,”
he pronounced. “But let us go in to supper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
boys. Perhaps by the time we’re through
some word may have arrived.”</p>

<p>But it hadn’t. And when Uncle Ralph
called up the Kenosha hotel a second and third
time the same laconic answer was always received—“No,
sir; they have not yet returned.”</p>

<p>“Well, that settles it,” cried Bob Somers, at
length. “We’ll motor right back to Kenosha
and find ’em.”</p>

<p>“What!—On a night so black that a black
cat would make a light spot in the landscape?”
exclaimed Captain Bunderley, protestingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that kind of thing doesn’t worry us,”
broke in Tom, eagerly. “Why, when we
were in Wyoming——”</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” groaned Charlie.</p>

<p>“Besides, it’s going to storm,” went on the
captain, seeing a look in Bob Somers’ eyes
which indicated a settled determination.</p>

<p>“We have everything to protect us from the
weather, sir. It’ll be a regular lark. Coming,
fellows?”</p>

<p>“Bet your life!” cried Tom, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Charlie Blake, however, held back.</p>

<p>“Oh, look here, Bob, what’s the use?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
demurred. “We might miss ’em, and have
all our trouble for nothing. It isn’t safe,
either, traveling——”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re afraid, that ends it,” put in
Tom, loftily.</p>

<p>“Who said I was afraid?” snapped the
“grind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nobody, of course,” said Tom, looking
very wise.</p>

<p>“Then don’t chatter like a goose.”</p>

<p>“Did I ever hear of such nerve! If——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, fellows,” laughed Bob. “Captain,
we’ll send you a telegram just as soon as
those chaps are rounded up.”</p>

<p>The former seaman smiled quizzically. To
his mind, talking about the trip in a brightly-lighted
room and actually undertaking it
were two such widely different propositions
that he had little confidence in the boys sticking
to their determination. “They may possibly
go as far as the city limits,” he thought,
“but that long stretch of lonely road and the
blackness will send ’em back.”</p>

<p>“Sure you want to try it?” he said, aloud.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, the very worst way,” laughed
Bob. “Now, Charlie——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p200.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELVES, BOYS”</p>

<p>Blake, anticipating what he was about to
say, and noticing a peculiar grin on Tom’s
face, held up his hand.</p>

<p>“I’m going,” he said, in remarkably sour
tones.</p>

<p>“That’s fine.”</p>

<p>Captain Bunderley gave each a hearty grasp
of the hand.</p>

<p>“Look out for yourselves, boys,” he cautioned.
“Remember: if I had any authority
over you I might not consent to your going.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry about us, sir,” said Bob.
“We’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“Down some embankment, I s’pose,” muttered
Charlie.</p>

<p>Outside, Bob took a good look at the sky.</p>

<p>“I guess the skipper is right about the
weather,” he remarked, as they started off in
the direction of the garage.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward the three arrived
at the building. It was a very large garage
containing many machines. The glare of
electric lights revealed none more imposing
than the Rambler Club’s motor car.</p>

<p>“Not a speck o’ mud left on her,” said the
man in charge. “Going out to-night, sir?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Right away,” answered Tom, with an air
of importance. “Pile in, fellows.”</p>

<p>The fellows “piled” in.</p>

<p>“We may be back to-night, and we may
not,” said the tall boy, handing over the
amount of the bill and a generous tip. “Let
’er go, Bob. So-long!”</p>

<p>A deafening roar abruptly filled the whole
room with thunderous echoes. Quick gasps
and throbs followed, while the exhausts flung
to the air whirling clouds of spent gases.
The two head and two side lamps threw a
brilliant glare over the floor and walls and cut
a pathway through the open door to the street
beyond.</p>

<p>The trembling machine, responding to its
master’s touch, glided forward.</p>

<p>“This sure ain’t no kind o’ a night for joy
ridin’,” remarked the man in charge, as he
watched the big car swinging into the highway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>ELEPHANTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys didn’t turn back at the city limits
as Captain Bunderley had fully expected they
would. Instead, the motor car finally passed
through South Milwaukee, and, under the
cool and skilful guidance of Bob Somers,
plunged steadily along the muddy road, its
lamps throwing a strange, fantastic stream of
light far in advance. Through its magic, objects
continually leaped out of the night, only
to be greedily snatched back by the mantle of
gloom. Lights suggestive of hobgoblins flitted
from tree to tree, or swept across fields and
underbrush, but in the immensity of space
beyond the glare blackness held supreme control.</p>

<p>Heavy gusts of wind, moaning and whistling
dismally in their hurried flight, almost
drowned the soft, even purring of the motor.
Splashing rain-drops hurled themselves
against the wind shield and top; the storm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
long delayed, was beginning to let loose its
pent-up wrath.</p>

<p>“Guess we’re going to have a peach of a
time,” muttered Blake. “If I hadn’t come,
though, Tom would have kidded me about it
for the next six months.”</p>

<p>The disconsolate “grind” huddled back on
the rear cushions listening to the wind and
rain and the soft swish of flying mud, as
the rubber-tired wheels occasionally plunged
through pools and puddles.</p>

<p>“Let ’er out a bit, Bob,” encouraged Tom.
“Don’t be afraid.” He pulled the collar of
his raincoat about his neck. “No constable
around now to stop our scorching. Gee!
Ought to have seen me burning up the road
to-day, Bob; good you weren’t along, Charlie.
Hey—asleep back there?”</p>

<p>“How in thunder could a fellow be asleep
with a din like this knocking against his ear-drums?”
growled Blake. “Where are we,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere between South Milwaukee and
Racine—that’s all I know,” answered the
driver, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The wind blew harder; the rain, too, gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
increased in force until sweeping torrents
beat hard against the motor car, splashing its
occupants and forming tiny trickling pools in
the bottom of the tonneau.</p>

<p>Not a vehicle had passed them; the country
seemed absolutely deserted, and only dim
points of light shining in the windows of
distant farmhouses indicated that any life
existed in the seeming wilderness.</p>

<p>The intense loneliness, the continual noises
of the storm and the haunting fear that hidden
dangers might be lurking in their path prevented
Blake from entering into the spirit of
the occasion.</p>

<p>“By Jove, this is certainly about the limit,”
he groaned, inwardly.</p>

<p>From his position the forms of Bob Somers
and Tom Clifton, bending low to escape the
cutting blasts, assumed a curiously unreal appearance
against the glare of acetylene light
streaming ahead. Leaning forward, he sought
vainly to pierce the blackness; then, his face
becoming the target for splattering rain-drops,
he hastily drew back, to straighten up again a
moment later as a shrill whistle sent a series
of wild reverberations across the landscape.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Over the air came faintly the rattle and
roar of a fast express. The road was taking
them near the tracks of the Chicago and
Northwestern Railway. Charlie’s glance suddenly
rested upon something in the distance—a
long row of tiny lights sweeping rapidly
toward them.</p>

<p>Now they disappeared; now flashed into
view once more; the sound of grinding car
wheels rose higher. Then, with almost incredible
rapidity, the tiny lights became gleaming
windows seeming to radiate cheer as they
sped onward through the night. In an instant
more the train was lost to view, and only a
faint screech of the locomotive’s whistle, fading
quickly into the roar of wind and splash
of rain, told of its passing.</p>

<p>“Wish I was on board,” sighed Charlie.
“Tom Clifton’s grins’ll never drag me into
any more silly adventures. This is ’most as
bad as that awful motor yacht trip. I’ve been
going some to-day, all right.”</p>

<p>On the front seat, Tom was saying:</p>

<p>“Motoring in such blackness is dandy fun.
The idea that you’re going to run into something
the next minute makes it kind of spicy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
eh? Gee, Bob, the rain’s coming down harder
every minute. Wonder where old Dave and
Victor are now?”</p>

<p>“Very likely taking it easy in the hotel,”
grinned Bob.</p>

<p>“Christopher! What’s that?”</p>

<p>A low rumbling sound had suddenly risen
above the warring of wind and rain.</p>

<p>“Thunder,” answered the chauffeur, briefly.</p>

<p>“Thunderation! I thought for a second it
was a message from Dave passing right over
our heads,” laughed Tom. “Some weather,
this, Bob. Hello—a village beyond!—See it?”</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon twirl that far behind us,” he
said.</p>

<p>The faint points of light dotting the gloom
gradually loomed up stronger; the white glare
from their lamps at length flashed over a
house by the roadside; then on another, and
within a few minutes the touring car was
sweeping steadily through the village.</p>

<p>Out from the darkness a small form seemed
to literally hurl itself toward them, and, racing
alongside, filled the air with vociferous barks
and yelps.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>Leaning over, Bob saw a shaggy form of
nondescript color, and caught a gleam from a
pair of greenish eyes.</p>

<p>“Nice doggie!” he chirped, soothingly.</p>

<p>“He’s started off every other ‘nice doggie’
in town,” chuckled Tom. “Listen!”</p>

<p>The baying of numerous canines, some near
at hand, others in the distance, was rising on
the air.</p>

<p>“Some up-to-the-minute constable may nab
us for disturbing sleeping dogs,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” grinned Bob.</p>

<p>He manipulated the lever. The car leaped
forward, leaving their four-footed foe far in
the rear. For a few moments, his senses
keenly alert for any signs of danger, he kept
up the swinging gait, slowing up as the lights
of a store and smithy close to it shot into view.</p>

<p>As they passed the latter a cheerful glow
was spreading out over the street from a
partly-open door. The boys caught a momentary
glimpse of figures and horses within, and
heard vigorous blows on an anvil sending
forth a series of musical notes.</p>

<p>Then the long street, silent and deserted,
slipped slowly by, and, presently, the motor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
car was threading its way in the zone where
human activities seemed to have ceased.
Another stretch of dreary blackness followed,
with the trees, in the grip of the blasting
air currents, soughing and snapping their
branches mournfully.</p>

<p>Pelting rain still assailed the travelers.
The motor car often rolled through deep pools,
scattering sheets of muddy spray aside. The
boys could hear the oozy, sucking sound of
slimy masses torn from their resting places
and spattering against the guards.</p>

<p>“Say, Bob, wouldn’t this be a great place
for the machine to break down?” came in a
sepulchral voice from the rear.</p>

<p>“You’d surely lose the polish on your
shoes, Charlie,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“Wonder what Vic ’ud say to this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’d let out an awful howl.”</p>

<p>“And no one could blame him, either,”
growled the disgusted Blake.</p>

<p>On and on went the car, through another
village and then another, and, finally, the
city of Racine was seen asserting itself strongly
against the gloom of nature.</p>

<p>The boys found on entering the town that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
most of the stores were closed; but the brightly-lighted
streets and the sight of electric cars
and an occasional pedestrian was a welcome
change after their siege of riding in the lonely
country.</p>

<p>“Too bad we can’t stay here for a while,
fellows!” exclaimed Bob, “but it’s the long
road and blackness again for us.”</p>

<p>“Dave and Vic are probably sound asleep
by this time,” grumbled Charlie, “never
dreaming about the lovely time we’re having
on their account.” Then he added, softly, to
himself: “Guess I’ll be having nightmares
about it, though, for weeks to come.”</p>

<p>“Speed her up, Bob,” said Tom, eagerly.
“A chap can see where he’s going out here.”</p>

<p>The street stretched straight ahead, with
not a vehicle in sight. The glare of electric
lights flashed on steadily falling rain; the
gutters ran with miniature floods, which
gurgled and splashed along, carrying on their
muddy surfaces a miscellaneous collection of
rubbish. Here and there great pools reflected
the buildings and telegraph poles with weird
effect.</p>

<p>Bob put on more speed; the motor car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
leaped forward, and for several blocks they
flew ahead at a breath-taking pace. An electric
car coming from the opposite direction
presently whizzed past, a confused mass of
blurred lights and shadows.</p>

<p>“This is simply great, Bob!” cried Tom.
“Enjoying yourself, Charlie?” he added,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>The “grind” was not; so the only answer
Tom’s query brought forth was a dissenting
grunt.</p>

<p>Occasionally Blake took a long, careful survey
of the situation. On looking out, a few
moments later, he saw a residential section
passing before his eyes. This was quickly
followed by the open country and desolation.</p>

<p>The storm, which had lulled during a short
period, broke forth with renewed activity.
At intervals coppery colored lightning
streaked across the heavens, or forked its
way to earth. In the brief instants of dazzling
glare a series of singularly clear impressions,
of dark, twisting clouds, of distant farmhouses,
of rail fences, of waving trees, and of
formless patches of shadow were imprinted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
upon Charlie’s brain. It filled the boy with
a curious sense of awe and dread which refused
to be shaken off.</p>

<p>“A bend in the road just ahead, Bob!”
Tom at length sang out.</p>

<p>“I see it,” responded the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The advancing rays of light showed the
broad road disappearing around a mass of
vegetation.</p>

<p>“Have to slow up now,” said Bob—“danger
of the machine skidding on slippery ground
like this.”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>As the touring car slackened speed Bob
sent forth a long, warning blast of the horn.</p>

<p>Tom laughed.</p>

<p>“Gee, Bob, what was the sense of doing
that?” he cried. “We haven’t passed many
drays and trucks, or——”</p>

<p>Blake, listening indifferently, would have
continued to do so but for the loud, startled
exclamation which brought Tom’s sentence
to an abrupt close.</p>

<p>He looked up quickly, then, with a gasp
of astonishment, he fell forward, bringing up
against the seat in front with a violent bump.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>The motor car had scarcely swept around
the bend when the acetylene glare picked out
from the darkness the forms of three huge
elephants advancing directly in their path.
Almost stupefied with amazement, the boys,
at the same instant, saw two men walking
close beside them. Not far behind, the light
shone upon a huge, red wagon.</p>

<p>Before the warning cries which came from
the men ceased Bob Somers had thrown out
the clutch and applied the brakes, bringing
the machine to a halt almost within its own
length.</p>

<p>A shrill trumpet call sounded. The elephant
in advance, showing evidence of the
greatest alarm, suddenly broke away from its
keeper and attempted to turn back.</p>

<p>Then followed a scene which made the
nerves of the chauffeur and his companions
tingle with excitement. A huge pachyderm,
wheeling his body around, effectually blocked
the other’s progress. Almost immediately the
third elephant got into action, while every
movement made by the men, in their efforts
to pacify the animals, only added to their fear
and confusion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Great Scott!” breathed Charlie, grasping
Bob by the arm.</p>

<p>The three towering forms were swinging
wildly toward them, the nearest threatening
to plunge full tilt against the motor car.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>A ROUGH TRIP</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Victor</span>, wouldn’t it be better for you to
skip back to the hotel?” asked Dave, looking
anxiously at the sky.</p>

<p>The lawyer’s son thought of the dark,
gloomy streets through which he would be
obliged to pass; then the idea of actually
traveling with a circus appealed strongly to
his imagination.</p>

<p>“No, Brownie,” he answered, decidedly.</p>

<p>“Joe,” said Dave, turning toward the circus
boy, “I see the light of a drug store over yonder;
guess they have a ’phone. I’m going to
call up the hotel. Can you wait, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Dave. But if Whiffin ketches me
busy at doin’ nothin’ it means a callin’ down—see?”</p>

<p>“All right, Joe; we’ll hurry,” said Dave,
encouragingly.</p>

<p>“An’ while you’re gone I’ll help git the
elephants ready,” announced Joe, with sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
decision. “Them three old codgers goes
ahead o’ us.”</p>

<p>Dave, followed by Victor, loped across the
wet, soggy lot, or, rather, tried to. But, although
the journey was attended by much
discomfort and some risk of taking a header,
they finally arrived at the drug store in safety.</p>

<p>Dave promptly called up the hotel and
was soon speaking to the night clerk. The
latter declined to open the telegram, but gave
the stout boy full information about the
’phone message which Captain Bunderley had
sent from Milwaukee.</p>

<p>“Well?” queried Victor, eagerly, as the
historian hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>Dave briefly explained.</p>

<p>“There, you big Indian, I knew it!” exclaimed
the lawyer’s son, triumphantly. “A
nice trick they played on us, eh? Well, I’m
liable to handle that Tom Clifton with awful
carelessness when we meet again. Now,
Brownie”—his tone became imperious—“you
just call up Uncle Ralph on the long distance
and tell him what’s what.”</p>

<p>With a broad smile, the stout boy obeyed.</p>

<p>To his disappointment, however, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
told that Captain Bunderley had retired for
the night.</p>

<p>“If it’s important we’ll get him right up
for you,” came a faint voice over the wire.</p>

<p>Dave did some rapid thinking. “Poor Joe
is most likely fretting and fuming about the
delay,” he mused. “Besides, if I wait any
longer there may be another mix-up.”</p>

<p>He spoke in the transmitter again:</p>

<p>“Thank you; I’m in too much of a hurry.
Will you kindly take down a message and
give it to the captain at once.”</p>

<p>The distant clerk assured him that he
would. Dave quickly went over the few facts
which he thought it was necessary for the
captain to know, ending with: “He’ll hear
from me in the morning.” “Good-bye” was
trembling on his tongue when an afterthought
prompted him to ask: “How many boys are
in the party?”</p>

<p>“Three,” came the answer.</p>

<p>“One very tall?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Any of them about?”</p>

<p>“No; all went out together some time
ago.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Thank you. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” demanded Victor.</p>

<p>“Yes; Tom is there, all right.” Dave
smiled. “Come on,” he added, seeing the
familiar expression of anger instantly flash
into the other’s face. He grasped the lad’s
arm and hurried him outside. “No time to
lose, Vic,” he urged. “Look, the main tent
is already down.”</p>

<p>“Just wait till I catch that tall chap!” exclaimed
Victor, savagely.</p>

<p>Over on the lot, Joe Rodgers, standing at
the head of a four-horse team, was impatiently
awaiting their reappearance.</p>

<p>“Here, you fellers, climb aboard fast,” he
roared, the moment his eyes lighted upon
their figures. “We ought to been off long
ago.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t an easy task for Victor to reach
the high seat, but, with considerable assistance,
he finally managed it. Then Joe, seeming
to possess the nimbleness of a monkey,
swung up beside him, while Dave, to Victor’s
great surprise, also showing much agility,
immediately followed.</p>

<p>At any other time Victor Collins’ sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the proprieties might have prevented him
from accepting a seat beside a boy whose
estate was as lowly as that of “Mister” Joe
Rodgers, but just now so many things engaged
his attention that he forgot to draw fine distinctions.
From his elevated perch he could
look over a scene in which the weird and
picturesque were combined with pleasing
effect.</p>

<p>By the aid of a brilliant calcium light and
lanterns men were busily engaged in loading
the remaining wagons. The workers hurried
about, now out of the glare, then back again;
the air was full of noise—of shouts, of heavy
planks being piled in place, of commands to
horses, of sledge-hammer blows. Lanterns
bobbed from place to place, suggestive of huge
fire-flies. It was all very interesting to Victor;
but Joe gave him no further time to
enjoy it.</p>

<p>Picking up the lines and raising his whip,
he yelled lustily:</p>

<p>“Git ap!”</p>

<p>Victor glanced curiously at the driver. He
wondered how it happened that a boy apparently
no older than himself was entrusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
with the care of a great four-horse team, and
being under such responsibility should show
not the slightest trace of nervousness.</p>

<p>Before the wagon was in motion a loud
“Hold on, there!” made all turn abruptly
around.</p>

<p>A man having three horses in tow was
headed straight for the wagon.</p>

<p>“Whiffin says I’m to tie this here bunch o’
nags on the back o’ the next wagon out,” explained
the man. “Is that you, Rodgers?”</p>

<p>“It sure ain’t nobody else,” growled Joe.
“Fasten ’em up quick, Tracy. The elephants
has went a’ready.”</p>

<p>Tracy performed his task with commendable
celerity.</p>

<p>“All right, Joe,” he presently called. “Let
’er go!”</p>

<p>“Git ap!” roared the driver.</p>

<p>The dull thud of hoofs striking against
the turf sounded; the leaders swung around,
plunged and reared. Down came an iron
shoe, splintering a stone and sending off a
shower of sparks. Joe’s whip swished viciously,
cracking like pistol shots.</p>

<p>“Whoa boy—haw! Hi, hi! Steady, Billikin!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Git over, there, you pesky brute!
Whoa boy!”</p>

<p>It required an immense amount of vocal
exercise, as well as tugging at the reins and
many passes with the whip to get the huge
bulk in motion. The wagon suddenly gave
an alarming creak, then lurched forward.
Joe yelled like a wild Indian. The horses
stamped and strained with all their might,
and in a few moments more the vehicle
was bumping and jolting over the uneven
ground.</p>

<p>“This here wagon’s chuck full o’ eats for
the hosses,” remarked Joe, when the road
was reached.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Brownie, it’s beginning to rain
again,” broke in Victor, complainingly.
“Isn’t that the meanest luck?”</p>

<p>“Here’s sumphin what’ll help keep it off
them pretty duds o’ yourn, Buster,” grinned
Joe. From the back of the seat he extracted
an oilskin cover and a huge umbrella. “Sneak
in clos’t, fellers,” he commanded when the
latter had been opened. “Then none o’ youse
won’t be drownded.”</p>

<p>Joe was handling the reins with remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
skill; the big wagon rumbled along the street
at good speed; and, on looking back, Dave
could see, barely perceptible in the gloom,
several others following.</p>

<p>“Say, Joe,” he exclaimed, suddenly, “are
you any relation to Mr. Whiffin?”</p>

<p>“I sure ain’t,” answered Joe.</p>

<p>“How does it happen that you’re working
in the circus?”</p>

<p>“’Cause when I weren’t no more’n twelve
years old I was left an orphan—understan’?
So off I goes to me fadder’s sister; an’ I stays
with her an’ her husban’ a spell.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“Like it? I should say not!” snorted
Joe. “I eats too much for ’em. One day
me an’ him has some words ’bout it; an’ he
up an’ says: ‘Git right out o’ here, ye young
cub.’ So I up an’ gits—see? I’m a purty
good feller, I am; but don’t nobuddy rile
me.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Dave, gravely. “What
did you do next?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I gits a job in a village; but the
feller I worked for corks me one over the ear,
so I up an’ gits ag’in—understan’?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“Have a hard time finding another place?”</p>

<p>Joe grinned.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he answered. “Drop me down
in the middle of anywheres an’ I’ll land on
me feet. I’ve newspapered it a bit.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to meet Mr. Whiffin?”</p>

<p>Joe failed to respond immediately. The
rain was beginning to beat hard against the
umbrella, while the furious gusts of wind
threatened every instant to tear it away.</p>

<p>Victor drew the oilskin as far up as he
could; but the beating drops still found him,
and began to trickle off his cap in tiny
streams.</p>

<p>“Ugh! This is about the limit,” he
groaned.</p>

<p>“If ye failed inter the lake it’d be a heap
worse,” remarked Joe, cheerfully. “It were
this way, Jumbo—I—I mean Dave—— Whoa
there! Confound that off hoss! Whoa—gee!
Git over there!—Well, I was lookin’ for a meal
ticket, when, of a suddent, I runs across—whoa,
gee—Spudger’s Peerless. So I goes in
an’ up an’ asks Whiffin for a job. ‘Git out o’
here,’ says Whiffin. ‘Sure—when I’m ready,’
says I. Then he kinder looks at me interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
like, an’ says, ‘Who chased yer away from
your happy home, kid?’ An’ I up an’ tells
him. So he gives me a job as water-carrier.”</p>

<p>“That’s interesting,” said Dave. “Go
ahead.”</p>

<p>“Whoa—gee! Confound that off hoss,”
resumed Joe. “Then, after while, he lets
me drive wagons and keer for the hosses.
There ain’t nuthin’ I don’t know about them
animals, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Satisfied with circus life, Joe?”</p>

<p>The boy pondered a moment.</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t,” he confided. “I’d like to
git an eddication, an’ be sumphin. But I
ain’t never had no chanc’t. I wonder if I
ever will have a chanc’t!” he added, wistfully.</p>

<p>“What is your ambition?” pursued Dave.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Maybe I’d like to keep a peanut,
pretzel and lemonade stand,” answered
Joe. “I know’d a feller what follered the
show with one. He did good, too—saved a
hundred and fifty dollars in three years. He’s
gittin’ old now—most twenty-five, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Poor decrepit old gentleman,” sighed Dave.
“Say, Joe,” he added, “does your uncle know
where you are?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“Sure! Whiffin up an’ writes ’im; an’
what Uncle Jim writ back must have been
hot stuff, ’cordin’ to Whiffin. But I kep’ me
job, all right.”</p>

<p>“Say, Brandon, why did you ever drag me
into a mess like this?” broke in a peevish
voice. “It’s raining worse every minute.”</p>

<p>“Too bad, Vic.”</p>

<p>Dave, with his cap pulled well over his eyes,
peered out.</p>

<p>The houses were becoming further and
further apart. Here and there lights in
windows shone dimly through the darkness.
The line of trees on either side of the road
rattled and snapped their myriads of branches,
occasionally surrendering to the wildly eddying
currents the quota of leaves demanded. Everything
was dripping wet; water fell from the
umbrella in streams; water slid ceaselessly down
the sides of the big red wagon; water formed
pools on top. From the nostrils and heaving
bodies of the blanketed horses came clouds of
steam.</p>

<p>Victor, though well protected, felt miserable
and disgusted and, as it was his nature to
always put the blame on others, he began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
harbor an additional grievance against Dave
Brandon.</p>

<p>“But for the big Indian I wouldn’t be
here,” he grumbled to himself. “And just
listen to the way he’s chinning to this Rodgers
kid! It certainly is enough to make a fellow
tired for a whole week.”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t never had no chanc’t,” Joe was
repeating, dolefully. “I ain’t no good at
readin’ or writin’.”</p>

<p>“Would you go to school?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I, though,” said Joe; “eh,
Buster?”</p>

<p>He nudged Victor sharply in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” growled Victor.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” grinned Joe. “Ribs is ginerally
cut out by surgeons. Whoa! Gee! It’s
most time we ketched up to them elephants.”</p>

<p>With his eyes keenly scanning the road,
he urged his team ahead by both voice and
whip. Now on a slight down grade, the huge
wagon rumbled along at considerable speed,
occasionally jolting and jarring, as the wheels
slipped into ruts or rolled through deep miry
stretches.</p>

<p>Dave finally detected two faint spots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
light struggling into view some distance
ahead.</p>

<p>“It’s Scotty an’ Robins leadin’ the elephants,”
explained Joe. “Know’d I ketch
up with ’em soon. Hi, hi! Git ap! Say,
this here is sure some storm, ain’t it, fellers?
Lightning now, by Jingo!”</p>

<p>A glare had suddenly illumined the landscape,
and in the instantaneous flash the forms
of three elephants at the crest of a rise showed
as blurred masses of dark.</p>

<p>“By George! It’s enough to give a chap
the creeps for fair,” thought Victor, with a
shiver.</p>

<p>Conversing was difficult. The three, though
huddling under the umbrella as far as possible,
were still the target for beating rain. At each
flash of lightning the huge, unwieldy forms
of Nero, Titan and Colossus loomed up more
clearly, and, at length, when the leading
horses began to strike their iron-shod hoofs in
the muddy road close behind them, the lanterns
in the hands of Scott and Robins described
a flashing circle in the air.</p>

<p>Joe answered this salute with a lusty yell.</p>

<p>“We’re gittin’ there, fellers,” he added.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“We’re most swimmin’ there,” answered
Robins, gruffly.</p>

<p>“And’ll soon need a raft,” put in Scotty.</p>

<p>“I’ll throw ye a life-line when ye needs
one,” roared Joe.</p>

<p>Then several miles fell grudgingly behind,
with scarcely a word exchanged between men
or boys. Dave, in spite of storm and discomfort,
his eyes tightly closed, was almost nodding,
while Victor, utterly miserable, sat
staring straight ahead.</p>

<p>But all this was changed in the most startling
and abrupt fashion.</p>

<p>The loud blasts of a motor horn, echoing
weirdly, brought Dave up with a start.</p>

<p>“What!” he gasped. “What!”</p>

<p>His eyes rested on a brilliant glare of light
flooding the darkness. Then a big touring
machine glided around a bend. Although
the chauffeur handled his car skilfully, the
unexpected sight threw the elephants into a
state of panic.</p>

<p>“Them brutes is goin’ to git!” yelled Joe,
as the rumbling of the wagon wheels ceased.</p>

<p>An instant later Dave and Victor saw the
boy swinging from his seat to the ground.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>DAVE DOES SOME RIDING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dave Brandon</span> immediately furnished another
example of his ability to move quickly
when he chose to stir himself. Joe had
scarcely landed before the stout boy was at his
side.</p>

<p>The crisp whirr of wheels and the thud of a
horse’s hoofs was sounding close behind them.
Dave stepped to one side, and, by the light
from a row of lanterns on the red wagon, saw
a buggy containing two men rapidly approaching.
Just after it had splashed past him one
of the men spoke up.</p>

<p>The thin, rasping notes which poured forth
at once proclaimed his identity; it was Mr.
Peter Whiffin.</p>

<p>Dave, however, in the general confusion,
amidst the noise of the storm and the shouts
of the elephant keepers, could scarcely understand
a word. The alarming actions of the
big animals, too, occupied his undivided attention.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
Despite the frantic efforts of Scott and
Robins, the pride of Spudger’s Peerless broke
away, the largest almost sending his cumbersome
body against the motor car.</p>

<p>The next few instants witnessed a scene
which made even the nerves of steady-going
Dave Brandon tingle with excitement. It
was impossible to tell which way the animals
might turn, and any one standing in the road
ran great danger of being knocked down and
trampled under foot.</p>

<p>But the movement of the big creatures was
not left long in doubt. With another loud
trumpeting, Colossus wheeled away from the
motor car, then started at a loping gait around
the bend, closely followed by Titan and Nero.</p>

<p>“I know’d it! I know’d it!” yelled Joe.
“An’ they’ll mash anythin’ flat what gits in
their way.”</p>

<p>“After ’em, boys; after ’em!” rose the voice
of Mr. Ollie Spudger, in despairing accents.
“We don’t want no more suits for damages
filed ag’in the show. If anybody as much
as sees the beasts runnin’ loose they’ll sue,
though only their feelin’s is hurt!”</p>

<p>Scott and Robins were already struggling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
through the mud and rain in a desperate
effort to overtake their charges.</p>

<p>“After ’em for all you’re worth, boys!”
bawled Spudger.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five cents for the feller what stops
’em!” roared Mr. Whiffin.</p>

<p>“I’ll take a chanc’t on gittin’ them five
nickels!” shouted Joe, snatching a lantern
from its place on the wagon and dashing off.</p>

<p>Dave Brandon was conscious of the fact that
the automobilists, after a sharp passage of
words with Mr. Whiffin, had gone on, apparently
thinking that the elephants would soon
be under control.</p>

<p>“That’s the way with them automobile
fellers,” he heard Mr. Whiffin exclaim.
“Don’t keer what happens as long as they
have their fling.”</p>

<p>Then the buggy wheels began grinding
through the mud again. Mr. Spudger and
his manager were in hot pursuit of elephants
and men.</p>

<p>Dave stood, irresolute, then:</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do it,” he exclaimed, grimly.
“As Joe says, if those animals should happen
to bump into anything—whew!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“What’s all that queer mumbling down
there, Brownie?” cried Victor. “Hey—where
are you going?”</p>

<p>Without making any reply, Dave unhooked
a lantern from the side of the wagon and
made a dash to the rear.</p>

<p>The rays of light flashed over three horses,
whose dilated nostrils and gleaming eyes gave
indication of their frightened state. They
strained and tugged frantically in an effort to
pull away.</p>

<p>“Whoa, boy, whoa!” exclaimed Dave,
soothingly, to the nearest, a coal black animal.
“Whoa, boy!”</p>

<p>Warily, he stepped out of the way of rapidly-moving
hoofs.</p>

<p>“Here’s where some of my cowboy experience
will come in nicely,” he murmured.
“Whoa there, old chap!” His hand gently
stroked a quivering, glossy neck. “Whoa, I
say!”</p>

<p>Working near those swinging bodies, in a
dim light, with rain and wind beating relentlessly
upon him, had an element of danger in
it which lent spice to the situation. Dave’s
lantern, slung over his arm, sent curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
patches of shadow dancing across the ground
and reflected in sharp metallic dashes in water
and ooze.</p>

<p>In a few moments the lad succeeded in
untying the rope. The black horse, freed,
reared and plunged; but Dave’s strong grip
on the halter could not be shaken off.</p>

<p>“It won’t be so easy riding you, old boy,
with no bridle or saddle,” he muttered, “but
here goes!”</p>

<p>“For gracious’ sake, what are you about,
Brandon?” screeched Victor, in alarm, for the
first time realizing his intention. “Look out,
you silly thing; you’ll get tossed or be
mashed into a jelly!”</p>

<p>To his unbounded amazement, he saw Dave
Brandon spring lightly astride the prancing
horse.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” he cried, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back soon, Vic,” shouted Dave.</p>

<p>He pressed his knees against the animal’s
side, leaned far over on its neck to escape the
full force of the storm, then, with both hands
gripping the halter, held on tight as the horse
shot forward.</p>

<p>Victor saw him being carried swiftly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
around the bend, the lantern over his arm
swaying violently, and heard the sound of
pounding hoofs growing faint in the distance.</p>

<p>It wrung from his lips a cry of admiration.</p>

<p>“By George, but that chap has wonderful
nerve!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all of Dave Brandon’s skill in
horsemanship was called into play. The spirited
black horse, frantic with fear, galloped
furiously along the slippery road, while Dave,
jolted and shaken, sawed hard on the leather
straps of the halter.</p>

<p>“Look out!” he yelled.</p>

<p>His ringing voice was added to the warning
of clattering hoofs.</p>

<p>Two dusky forms edged with sharp lights
from the rays of their lanterns sprang hastily
to the side of the road as the apparent runaway
bore down upon them. Another, further
in advance, loping along at remarkable
speed—Joe Rodgers, in a desperate sprint to
capture the promised quarter—was seen to
stumble.</p>

<p>Dave had a vision of a lantern performing
some remarkable evolutions, and knew, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
by impressions than actual sight, that Joe
Rodgers had taken a header to safety in the
mud.</p>

<p>And all this time the red lantern on the
back of Spudger’s vehicle was growing larger
and stronger. A mass of formless dark, with
surprising suddenness, resolved itself into the
shape of a buggy and trotting horse.</p>

<p>As Dave sped past he heard loud exclamations
and yells in Peter Whiffin’s familiar
voice. Then he was plunging on and on into
the blackness, with nothing but an occasional
gleam of electric flame to light the way.</p>

<p>At last, after a determined fight, he regained
control of the maddened animal. His face
was stinging from the effects of beating rain
and wind and his eyes were aching. But the
wild ride had filled him with a strange sense of
exhilaration.</p>

<p>As a vivid streak of bluish lightning forked
its way earthward, the rider gave a gasp of
astonishment and alarm. The instantaneous
glare had revealed with startling clearness the
ponderous forms of three elephants but a few
yards distant. Even before the jarring reverberations
of thunder began to sound the dull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
thud of heavy feet splashing steadily through
mud and water reached Dave Brandon’s ears.</p>

<p>It was a moment for quick action and
steady nerves.</p>

<p>By the time his fierce yells and strenuous
exertions had swerved the horse to one side
the light of the lantern was falling on a huge
bulk which towered high above him. He saw
the elephant’s great head swing around, its
eyes gleaming with fear.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” murmured Dave.</p>

<p>His nerves tingled at the thought of being
thrown.</p>

<p>He steered clear of a second shadowy form
and soon a third detached itself faintly from
the surroundings.</p>

<p>The already badly frightened Colossus
became a great deal more so as horse and rider
shot alongside. A shrill trumpet call rang
out. The huge elephant increased his pace,
blocking every effort of the horseman to
gallop past. And so, neck and neck, the
animals raced along the lonely, water-soaked
country road.</p>

<p>Every flash of lightning brought into view
fences on either hand. Dave knew there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
no safety on either side or behind. Only his
horse’s speed could carry him out of the
dangerous situation in which he had placed
himself. The touch of a great rough body
brushing against his shoulder sent a thrill to
his heart.</p>

<p>“This is just a little more than I bargained
for,” he thought, grimly.</p>

<p>“Get up, Blacky, get up!” he cried out,
desperately. His hand descended hard on the
animal’s flank. “Go it, old boy! Go it, for
your life!”</p>

<p>Dave strained his eyes to pierce the darkness,
fearful that the obscurity concealed some
object into which they would be plunged with
headlong force.</p>

<p>It was one of the most thrilling moments in
Dave Brandon’s life. Never before had he
taken so many chances; and never before had
he been so determined to win.</p>

<p>The boy could hear the labored breathing
of his horse and saw patches of foam flung to
the wind. The rapid pace over the rough
road was fast telling on the animal’s strength.
Thus, through the night and storm, the
wild flight continued, with neither gaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
any advantage until the black horse, by a
supreme effort, nosed ahead of its monster
rival.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Blacky!” shouted Dave,
exultingly.</p>

<p>His lantern whirled in front of Colossus’
head, then again, and again, while he yelled
with all his remaining force.</p>

<p>Each time he was in danger of being hurled
from his seat; each time the exertion made
his heart thump harder. But the actions of
the big elephant caused him to keep up the
fight with every ounce of strength in his body.</p>

<p>The panic-stricken beast seemed to have no
desire to face that curious flashing light which
occasionally grazed his upraised trunk. The
pride of Spudger’s, seeing no escape from
the terrifying object in front, voiced his fear
in another loud call, swung abruptly across the
road and continued along on the other side.</p>

<p>Dave promptly met this move by a shift of
the lantern.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, Colossus slowed up,
while the stout boy, feeling that the victory
had been won, reined in his steaming horse,
so as to keep directly in front of the elephant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Within a few minutes the struggle was over.
The pachyderm, unable to elude the horseman,
wavered, then came to a sudden stop.</p>

<p>Dave Brandon was too winded to shout his
exultation. He wheeled his horse around and
halted in the middle of the road. Water
poured from his hat and coat in streams; his
clothes were patched with mud, but, as he
wearily straightened up, the glow of the lantern
showed the familiar broad smile on his
face.</p>

<p>“By Jingo,” he muttered, “traveling with
a circus surely has its thrills!”</p>

<p>Some five minutes later, when Messrs.
Spudger and Whiffin hurriedly drove up, in a
state of great excitement, they found three
elephants huddled close together by the wayside,
while a lone horseman, almost as motionless
as a statue, was standing on guard.</p>

<p>And it didn’t take Mr. Whiffin’s sharp eyes
very long to discover the identity of this
vigilant sentinel.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell yer it was the fat feller who
passed us, Mr. Spudger?” he demanded, “an’
by gum, he done the trick!”</p>

<p>“And I should say, at twenty-five cents, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
was about the cheapest bit of work I ever heard
of. And if he’s saved me from looking into
any lawyer’s face I’ll add another twenty-five
cents myself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spudger laughed gruffly at his own
humorous observation.</p>

<p>“We’d best be keerful not to make too
much noise,” warned Mr. Whiffin. “I ain’t
hankerin’ to look after them elephants.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Mr. Spudger. “Let’s
do all our conversation in whispers. If they
ever git started on the back track this buggy
would be only fit for kindlin’ fires, and I don’t
like surgeons no more’n lawyers.”</p>

<p>After this remark only the noise of the
storm was heard until Joe Rodgers, a sadly
bedraggled object, arrived on the scene of
inaction.</p>

<p>“Stand as still as if you was a-loafin’ on
the show, Joe,” commanded Whiffin, disagreeably.
“If it hadn’t been for that there
quarter you wanted to git you’d be asleep on
the wagon now.”</p>

<p>Scott, the elephant trainer, with his assistant,
Robins, next appeared, and the men
quickly secured their charges.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>A few specks of light on the road and the
low rumble of wagon wheels soon indicated
that the circus train was approaching.</p>

<p>“You’re the greatest feller in the world,
Dave!” exclaimed Joe, admiringly. “I’ll
bet Bill Potts never would have done it.”</p>

<p>“His forte is artistic riding,” laughed Dave.
“Out on the plains with the cowboys taught
me the plain variety.”</p>

<p>The leaders of the four-horse team swung
up and the driver, who had taken Joe’s place,
clambered to the ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, hasn’t this been another glorious
day!” piped a small figure on the seat. “Are
you safe, Brownie? Goodness, but this has
given me an awful fit of the nerves.”</p>

<p>“I’m all right, Vic,” answered Dave. He
led the black horse to its former place behind
the wagon. “What’s that? Did you speak,
Mr. Whiffin?”</p>

<p>A voice had come from the buggy.</p>

<p>“Step this way,” said the manager.</p>

<p>When his summons were obeyed he leaned
out from beneath the shelter, extending a
lean hand toward Dave’s indistinct form.</p>

<p>“Here’s that quarter, boy!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“And you needn’t give a receipt for it just
now,” guffawed Mr. Spudger.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” laughed Dave.</p>

<p>Joe, already in his place, his hands grasping
the lines, waited until Dave Brandon was
seated beside him, then his long whip cracked
sharply, the horses plunged and struggled,
the wheels reluctantly began to move, and the
interrupted journey was resumed.</p>

<small>VIC TURNS UP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> motor car boys arrived late at night,
or, rather, early in the morning at Kenosha,
left their mud-begrimed machine at the garage,
and hastened to the hotel. There, to their
great satisfaction, they learned about Dave’s
telephone message, then, with minds relieved
from all further anxiety, congregated in Bob
Somers’ room.</p>

<p>“Well, we have made a night of it,” began
Charlie.</p>

<p>“And a morning, too,” piped Tom.</p>

<p>“The last of yesterday and the first of to-day
have been nicely rolled together,” laughed
Bob.</p>

<p>“Say”—Tom managed to stifle a tremendous
yawn—“I certainly like the nerve of that
fellow in the buggy.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I didn’t like about him,”
said Charlie. “It’s sure that he never took any
correspondence school lessons in politeness.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“And the idea of his taking down our
license number! Honest, Bob, I came mighty
near calling him down for that.”</p>

<p>“He made a noise like a steam calliope,
but he couldn’t take us down,” grinned Bob.</p>

<p>“I certainly hope we don’t meet him again,”
yawned Charlie.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t know him from a baseball
bat,” said Tom. “By this time, fellows, I
reckon Dave and Victor have made a safe
steal for home—meaning they’ve reached
Milwaukee.”</p>

<p>“And if so Captain Bunderley won’t be
put out,” chirped Blake.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that is where Dave and Vic
really have gone,” mused Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, of course!” answered Tom, making
an heroic attempt to control his blinking eyes.</p>

<p>“Let us have some deductions, quick, Tom,”
urged Charlie, with a wink.</p>

<p>“Look out, or I’ll make you run like a ball
player off for first!” said Tom, scowling
slightly.</p>

<p>“But no one could throw me out,” retorted
the “grind.”</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll turn in, fellows,” remarked Bob.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
“Remember we have to hit the trail again
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I can never forget the agonizing look of
the chap who had to clean our car,” quoth
Charlie. “Wasn’t it the biggest cake of mud
you’ve ever seen? Good-night, Bob. Tom
will yawn his head off in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” scoffed Tom. “I’m not a bit
more tired than anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I s’pose you’d like to do it all
over again,” laughed Charlie. “Coming?”</p>

<p>And Tom went.</p>

<p>It was very late when the boys got up; in
fact, so late that a glance at the clock seemed
to give each a pang of conscience.</p>

<p>“Simply awful,” murmured Tom. “Can’t
understand it. Why, I didn’t feel a bit tired
last night.”</p>

<p>Immediately after refreshing themselves
with a good meal the boys started for the
garage.</p>

<p>Benjamin Rochester, more than ever convinced
that there was something very mysterious
in the actions of the crowd, received them
with the gravity due to such somber thoughts.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, de car am done been cleaned,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
he remarked to Bob Somers. “I guess dat
machine tried to burrow its way to de center
ob de earth.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was as dark as a tunnel last night,”
explained Bob, “and we hit some of the soft
spots.”</p>

<p>“Guess yo’ must hab scooped ’em all up.”</p>

<p>Two minutes later the car was whirling out
of the garage.</p>

<p>“Dey is certainly de queerest bunch I done
ebber heard ob,” muttered Benjamin. “I
s’pects I’ll read somethin’ ’bout ’em in de
papers befo’ long.”</p>

<p>Through the streets of Kenosha, by the
shortest route, sped the big machine. Charlie
Blake’s association with the Ramblers was
beginning to have an effect upon his timid
disposition. His mind was no longer filled
with dread misgivings, and Bob, who thought
that his chief trouble lay in a lack of confidence
in himself, kept urging him to try his
hand at running the car.</p>

<p>And finally Blake, to Tom’s great astonishment,
did try.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, you’re going some now!”
exclaimed the tall boy. “Play ball with that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
kind of spirit and we’ll have a winning
nine.”</p>

<p>“Bully boy,” said Bob, resuming his place
at the wheel. “You’ve got the hang of the
thing in great shape.”</p>

<p>Blake felt a glow of satisfaction. He was
beginning to realize just why he had so often
failed.</p>

<p>With Bob in control, the landscape seemed
to fly by with astonishing rapidity, and evidences
that they were approaching a big town
soon greeted their eyes.</p>

<p>“Say, look at that, fellows!” exclaimed
Tom, suddenly.</p>

<p>A gorgeously colored poster by the side of
the road depicted some of the “Stupendous
attractions” of Ollie Spudger’s Great Combined
Peerless Circus and Menagerie.</p>

<p>“That’s worth looking at,” said Bob, bringing
the machine to a stop.</p>

<p>“They’re going to stay on the scene for three
days,” remarked Tom. “Say, Bob, that must
be the very show we passed on the road last
night. Let’s motor around and take a squint.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness, I never cared less to see a
circus,” put in Charlie.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“Well, it won’t do any harm.”</p>

<p>“Or any good, either.”</p>

<p>“Then that makes it even, eh, Bob? How
do you vote?”</p>

<p>“We might as well run around that way,
Tom.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Clifton won’t be happy unless
he can give the elephants peanuts,” grunted
Charlie.</p>

<p>The scattered buildings had given place to
long rows. Along a wide avenue lined on
both sides with handsome residences the
Rambler Club’s motor car carried the three
toward the business section of Racine. Again
the chauffeur was obliged to look out for cars,
vehicles and pedestrians, but, as no time was
lost save when absolutely necessary, the town
was quickly crossed.</p>

<p>At length they came in sight of several
circus tents rising in the midst of a vast lot.
They could see, too, a number of huge red
wagons, a miscellaneous collection of venders’
stands and a considerable crowd seeming to
move in all directions.</p>

<p>“Gee! Looks like some show to me,”
remarked Tom, highly interested. “Mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
big pictures they have hanging up by the
entrance.”</p>

<p>“That’s high art,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” queried Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s easy; they’re at least six feet off the
ground.”</p>

<p>“Huh, you’re getting real smart,” snapped
Tom.</p>

<p>“I’m stocking up with ginger for the football
games,” laughed Charlie.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can see the barker barking,” said
Tom, suddenly. “Aren’t they the windy
chaps? I’m just a little bit too cute to be
taken in by them. Say, wouldn’t you think
a man would have more self-respect than to
stand out there sporting a red coat and dinky
little cap like that?”</p>

<p>“Strikes me he’s a kind of fat fellow,” said
Blake, with an earnest stare. “He ought to
be out doing some useful work instead of trying
to separate dimes and nickels from a lot
of easy marks. Just look at the way he moves
his arms!”</p>

<p>“You might think he was a lawyer pleading
a case in court,” laughed Bob. “I guess
he would about match Dave in size.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“Hello!” said Charlie, his eyes resting on
one of the large paintings. “There’s a picture
of Adolphus, the boy giant. His figure seems
to match our Tom’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out the Victor Collins remarks,”
growled Clifton. “Stop here, Bob. It’s jolly
good fun to watch the people. Crickets, what
a noise! Why—why—what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Bob Somers was staring toward the barker
with a mystified expression which gradually
deepened. He was about to speak, when:</p>

<p>“My gracious alive, if there isn’t that fellow,
Tom Clifton!” came to their ears.</p>

<p>The three boys turned quickly at the sound
of a familiar voice, and, to their utter astonishment,
found themselves facing Victor Collins.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>EXPLANATIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> as was the amazement of the boys
to see Victor, his next words amazed them
still more.</p>

<p>“Come down out of that, Clifton, and I’ll
punch you good and plenty!” he howled.</p>

<p>Before Tom Clifton could gather his wits
together and reply, Victor was speaking again.</p>

<p>“That was about the meanest and silliest
trick I ever heard of!” he exclaimed, brandishing
a small white fist in the air. “I’ve
got it in for you, too, Blakelets; and ditto for
you, Bob Somers.”</p>

<p>The group in the motor car exchanged
glances of bewilderment. Then the chauffeur
spoke up.</p>

<p>“How did you get here, Victor?” he asked.</p>

<p>This question seemed to increase Victor’s
fiery attitude.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t try to jolly me,” he screeched.
“Put that innocent look off your face, Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
Clifton. And if you’re not too scared step
down and get the first instalment of what’s
coming to you!”</p>

<p>Tom Clifton, fairly aghast, flushed crimson.
For him to be threatened in the presence of
his chums by a boy of Victor’s size was more
than his feelings could stand.</p>

<p>Words and actions came to his relief.
Springing to the ground he seized Victor by
the arm.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, you silly little duffer?”
he exclaimed, fiercely. But, like a
flash, the thought came to him that, after
all, it might be only a joke. “Oh, it’s all
right, Victor,” he added, with forced calmness.
“You can’t string me.”</p>

<p>“Or rope me into believing any taffy. I’ll
show you how much joke there’s in it!”</p>

<p>Something happened.</p>

<p>Victor’s small fists began to move with
truly remarkable speed. It was Tom Clifton’s
ribs that stopped several snappy punches.</p>

<p>“Ouch! Quit it!” yelled Tom, jumping aside
with undignified haste. “Stop—stop, I say!”</p>

<p>But whichever way he turned Victor was
always dancing before him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“You would make me miss that motor
yacht trip, eh? Thought maybe I looked
soft, eh? Well, here’s one for that!”</p>

<p>Two pairs of restraining hands suddenly
gripped Victor Collins’ shoulders.</p>

<p>“No more of this, Vic,” commanded Bob,
sternly. “We don’t want to start a rival
show on this side of the street.”</p>

<p>“You’re making more noise than that fat
barker over there!” added Charlie.</p>

<p>Tom Clifton, painfully conscious that he had
made no effort to defend himself, and feeling
the various assortment of punches which Victor
had liberally bestowed upon him, suddenly
decided that his reputation would suffer
unless some decisive action was taken.</p>

<p>A good shaking, he thought, would be
about the proper thing.</p>

<p>“I’ll tend to him myself, Bob. Leave the
whole thing to me!” he cried.</p>

<p>While Victor squirmed and struggled in
Bob Somers’ strong grasp, Charlie, bubbling
over with mirth, had secured a firm hold on
Tom Clifton’s arm.</p>

<p>“I guess the circus has been too much for
somebody’s nerves,” he chuckled. “Better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
stop. There are about eighteen people looking
over.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” stormed Tom.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Bob. “Let’s begin at the beginning,
and come to the end fast. Victor
seems peeved about something. Speak up,
Vic: what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>Realizing that the odds were too great to
overcome, Victor simmered down.</p>

<p>“There’d be thirty-nine people looking at
us if I had my way,” he said, sullenly.
“This thing isn’t ended yet. Tall Indians
are easy for me.”</p>

<p>“Then explanations ought to be easy,”
laughed Bob.</p>

<p>Victor poured forth the story of his woes
with a volubility that showed a strong grip
on the English language, and, as he proceeded,
the faces of the three completely
changed expression. Bob and Charlie fairly
roared with mirth, while Tom, backing up
against the motor car, seemed almost too astonished
to speak.</p>

<p>“We had our trip on the yacht,” cried
Blake, between his peals of laughter.</p>

<p>“And Tom did motor it to Milwaukee,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
supplemented Bob. “But ‘things are not
always what they seem.’”</p>

<p>Briefly he explained the situation. His
manner and tones were so convincing as to
completely silence Victor Collins’ suspicions.
The angry look slowly faded from his eyes.
He stuck his hands into his overcoat pocket
and whistled shrilly.</p>

<p>For once in his life Victor had learned a
lesson.</p>

<p>The story of Tom’s brilliant deductions
was, of course, too good to keep, so the
“grind,” in spite of the tall boy’s frantic
winks, gave all the details with a charming
disregard for his feelings.</p>

<p>The sheepish expression which had rested
on Victor’s face gave place to an enormous
grin. He laughed quite as loudly as Bob and
Charlie had done a few moments before.</p>

<p>“Well,” growled Tom, “can you blame
me? Weren’t you all twisted up yourself?
I went down to the wharf and saw——”</p>

<p>“So did Brandon and I; and all we saw
was a mean-looking little fat man. He had
the nerve to come up and begin talking.
‘No; not even the glitter of a cent,’ I told the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
beggar. Whew, wasn’t he hopping mad,
though! You ought to have seen how he beat
it.”</p>

<p>“A little fat man!” cried Tom, opening his
eyes. “Why—why, he must have been the
very one that told me about the boys going off
on the yacht.”</p>

<p>“He did?” gasped Victor.</p>

<p>“Yes! Why, he wasn’t any beggar. It
wouldn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to see that
he had sized up the situation and was going
to tell you all about it. If you had only
given him half a chance, Victor Collins,
this——”</p>

<p>“What! Are you going to try and put the
blame on me?” interrupted Victor, fiercely.
“It wouldn’t have changed things at all—not
a bit of it. I knew the whole crowd had
skipped.”</p>

<p>“Say, fellows!” Bob Somers’ loud exclamation
put an end to the wrangle. “No
wonder that chap over there has a shape like
Dave’s! It is Dave; and I knew it!”</p>

<p>“Why, of course it is!” snapped Victor.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Tom. “What—that
fellow with the red coat and dinky little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
cap our Dave? Somebody fan me with a
feather.”</p>

<p>“A rope’s end would suit your case better.
Yes; Brandon has had to earn his own living
for once.”</p>

<p>“Help!” murmured Charlie. “This has
been almost too much for my weak intellect.”</p>

<p>“Now, Vic, do let us have an explanation!”
cried Bob.</p>

<p>“You might have told us before, instead of
raising such a howl about me,” broke in Tom.</p>

<p>Victor immediately launched forth into a
vivid description of their experiences with the
circus. He had a great deal to say, but the
boys did not stand still while listening to it.
Each was too anxious to see David Brandon in
his new and astonishing rôle. They rapidly
crossed the street, then made as straight a line
as booths, stands and people would permit
toward the entrance to the show.</p>

<p>All the sights and sounds peculiar to circuses
were on every side. Their thoughts,
however, were centered upon the boy with the
red coat and tasseled cap who seemed to be
talking as easily and naturally as though
merely reciting in school.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>In the midst of an impassioned argument
Dave caught sight of his friends. He waved
his arm, but that was all he could do in the
way of greeting.</p>

<p>The end of Victor’s story fell on inattentive
ears.</p>

<p>Tom felt his heart swell with pride—pride
that Dave—their Dave—had again shown
his versatility. Forgetting diffidence, he
yelled:</p>

<p>“You didn’t know our automobile passed
you on the road last night, eh, Dave?”</p>

<p>And a moment after these words were
spoken he observed a small, thin man, who
had been staring toward them, start forward.
He also noticed, as the man approached, that
he was scowling angrily.</p>

<p>“Say, boys,” he exclaimed, in a voice which
the Ramblers had heard on the night before,
“so it was your car that passed us on the
road, eh? Well, I’ve got a word to say!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>DAVE RESIGNS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Peter Whiffin</span>, straining his neck in
an effort to look squarely into Tom Clifton’s
eyes, also waved his finger threateningly in
the air.</p>

<p>“Things has came to a pretty pass when a
lot of irresponsible kids can go chasin’ all
around creation in a motor car. Do you
know what you done last night?”</p>

<p>The familiar flush appeared once more on
Tom Clifton’s face as many pairs of eyes were
leveled in his direction.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder it doesn’t mean a ten thousand
dollar suit for damages!” thundered
Mr. Whiffin, savagely. “An’ it’s only by
good luck that you ain’t mixed up in the
biggest kind of a rumpus. That car o’ yourn
stampeded our elephants—that’s what it
done!”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry to hear it,” spoke up Bob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
Somers, quietly, “but you can hardly blame
us. We had just as much right to the road
as you.”</p>

<p>“No sass, now!” cried Whiffin.</p>

<p>Tom was trembling with indignation.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re handing some out
yourself,” he managed to say.</p>

<p>“I’m good at it,” snapped Whiffin. “Anybody
what deserves sass gits their full share
from me.”</p>

<p>“By George, if I’d only known it was the
Ramblers in that car,” cried Victor, recovering
from his surprise, “maybe some mud balls
wouldn’t have been flying!”</p>

<p>“I must say this has been a wonderful
motor car trip,” remarked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Just supposin’ them elephants had run
inter somethin’?” Mr. Whiffin’s querulous
tones rose above all other sounds. “Just
supposin’ a farmer’s wagon had been in the
way——”</p>

<p>“Or a picnic party,” broke in Tom, satirically.</p>

<p>No doubt Mr. Whiffin would have made a
very interesting retort but for the fact that
his eyes happened to rest on the form of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
stocky, freckle-faced boy. This lad, attracted
by the sound of his voice, had come forward
and was taking in the scene with much apparent
interest.</p>

<p>The audacity of such a proceeding seemed
to appal Mr. Peter Whiffin.</p>

<p>“Loafin’ ag’in, eh?” he snarled. “Expect
to be supported in idleness, I reckon! You
ain’t done scarcely nothin’ since I hired that
new barker.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t, eh?” Joe Rodgers’ eyes
flashed angrily. “Oh, no; I ain’t done
nothin’ but work me arms an’ legs most off!”</p>

<p>“Light out!” commanded the manager.</p>

<p>“When I gits ready I will,” answered Joe,
defiantly. “Hey, fellers, I heard all that.
So you’re the ones what Jumbo, I—I mean
Dave told me about? An’, say, he’s the
bulliest feller in the whole world. Anybody
what could do what he done last night ought
ter have a medal.”</p>

<p>“Permit me to introduce into your charmed
circle the esteemed and particular crony of
Mr. David Brandon—Joseph Rodgers, Esquire,
water-carrier by special appointment to Oily
Spudger’s Great Show,” snickered Victor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>The boys greeted Joe politely.</p>

<p>“If the fat feller belongs to a bunch like
this it’s most enough to make me fire him,”
growled the manager. “Have you watered
them elephants, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Sure I have.”</p>

<p>“And wiped off them cages?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know what yer next job is. Git!”</p>

<p>“Don’t have to.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whiffin was both amazed and angry.</p>

<p>“It’s all the doin’s o’ that there new
barker,” he declared, emphatically. “He’s
been fillin’ yer head full o’ cranky notions.
Ye’re gittin’ too big fer your place.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t so!” Joe flung back, spitefully.</p>

<p>“I’ll look inter this here affair, an’ if that
fat feller keeps meddlin’ inter other people’s
business I’ll hand him somethin’ what he
won’t never forgit.”</p>

<p>“A fine bit of gratitude for stopping the
runaway elephants!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Mr. Whiffin is going to give you all free
passes,” spoke up Victor, loudly. “Step right
over to the box office and get ’em!”</p>

<p>The manager glared at the crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“If that’s what ye’re after, pass straight
along,” he snarled. “I wouldn’t want you
in the show at fifty cents per. Like as not
you’d stampede the whole menagerie!”</p>

<p>The furious blast of the ten thousand dollar
band starting up made further conversation
almost impossible. As though the music conveyed
some signal to the brain of Mr. Whiffin
and his protégé, they immediately started off,
and, by the simple process of mingling with
the crowd, were soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>“The automobile hasn’t bumped anything,”
laughed Bob, “but a whole lot of things have
bumped us.”</p>

<p>The boys, seeing that there would be no
chance to interview the barker for some time,
concluded to take the car to the nearest garage.</p>

<p>“I always knew that Dave could do a lot of
things,” said Tom, as he climbed into the
machine, “but who ever thought he could
stand up before a crowd and talk like that?”</p>

<p>“And didn’t he look perfectly stunning in
that red coat and pretty little cap?” remarked
Charlie Blake, with a sly glance at each of the
others. “Aren’t we the brainy chaps on this
trip, though?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“A hulking big thing like that ought to be
out working on a farm,” roared Bob.</p>

<p>With a loud honk, honk, the motor car was
off, and twenty minutes later the four were
back at the circus.</p>

<p>They found the lot in the grip of a frenzy
of sound. Dave was hammering on a gong,
the ringing notes of which even overtopped
the most strenuous efforts of the hard-working
band; and this medley of sound was punctuated
at intervals by the cries of venders, or the
shrill whoops of children.</p>

<p>“It’s a dandy show, all right,” said Victor.</p>

<p>“If Whiffin had gotten me to do the barking
instead of Dave——” began Tom. “Hey,
what are you laughing about?” he demanded,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing!” gurgled Victor. “Excuse
me, but the thought of you chinning to a
crowd somehow gave me a fit of the laughs.”</p>

<p>“Then get over it. I was going to say that
there would have been a fine row if he’d tried
any of his prattling on me.”</p>

<p>“My, oh my, isn’t that awful to think of?”
snickered Victor.</p>

<p>Tom tossed his head scornfully, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
about to join in a rush for the ticket wagon
when Bob stopped him.</p>

<p>“I want to get a chance to speak to Dave
first,” he said. “Plenty of time yet, Tom.”</p>

<p>“The tent seems to be actually swallowing
people,” objected Clifton. “There won’t be
any places left.”</p>

<p>“Only wish they were turning hundreds
away,” exclaimed Charlie. “Then we wouldn’t
be able to go in.”</p>

<p>When the stampede to gain admission was
over the band ceased playing with remarkable
promptness, and Dave as promptly resumed
speaking.</p>

<p>It was clearly evident that those who failed
to avail themselves of the opportunity of seeing
the great Spudger show on that particular
afternoon would be making one of the most
amazing mistakes of their lives. Dave almost
said as much.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness we haven’t missed it,”
said Bob, with a smile. “Oh,” he turned
abruptly at the sound of a voice—“you here
again, Joe!”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t nobody else,” chuckled Joe.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rodgers looks like a living danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
signal,” said Charlie, his eyes scanning Joe’s
flaming red vest.</p>

<p>The circus boy seemed to construe this as a
great compliment. He grinned complacently.</p>

<p>“You fellers is certainly all to the good,”
he said, graciously. “An’, say, isn’t Dave a
Jim dandy?”</p>

<p>“Of course he is,” laughed Charlie. “How
do you like circus life, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Not as much as I did afore I met Dave,”
answered Joe. “He kinder started me
a-thinkin’. I ain’t got no eddication, an’ he
says if I don’t never begin I won’t have no
chanc’t to get up in the band wagon. An’,
say”—the freckle-faced boy laughed—“I
wish’t I could play music.”</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p>“’Cause them fellers has an easy job.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m wise to ’em. Often, when the
leader weren’t a-lookin’, I’ve seen ’em quit
playin’—honest, I have. An’ when he gits
his eyes on ’em ag’in an’ waves that there club
o’ hisn, they starts up like mad.”</p>

<p>“Deceitful rascals,” murmured Charlie,
trying to stifle a suspicious gurgle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>Within a short time the boys found their
opportunity to speak to Dave. They shook
hands as heartily and their tongues wagged as
rapidly as though weeks had separated them.
Making the best of the few minutes which
were at their disposal, enough was said to
render the situation clear all around.</p>

<p>They learned that Dave expected to be with
Spudger’s until the next day, and that he had
written a letter to Captain Bunderley.</p>

<p>“I told him Vic and I would leave for
Milwaukee just as soon as my work was over,”
explained the stout boy.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried Tom. “Then there is
nothing for us to do but enjoy ourselves.”</p>

<p>“An’ I’ll show you the best seats in the
house,” added Joe. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Of course Tom was too dignified to show
any visible effects of the pleasing sensations
which seized him as he entered the abode of
pomp and sawdust. He had never before seen
so much of either.</p>

<p>As the performance was about to begin, Joe
immediately conducted them to the reserved
seat section, where real chairs took the place
of piles of lumber.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“We haven’t stampeded the menagerie and
it’s cost us only twenty-five cents per,” laughed
Bob.</p>

<p>Dave, minus his red coat and cap, soon
joined them; and from their point of vantage
they witnessed the “Stupendous and Gorgeous
Spectacle” which Spudger always gave to his
patrons.</p>

<p>After the show, when the crowds had departed,
Dave took the crowd to the small side
tent and introduced them to “Little” Georgy,
Zingar, the Randolpho family and Ormond
de Sylveste. The circus people all expressed
profound gratification at the meeting. The
young giant was particularly charmed.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if you’d
have a job like mine some day,” he remarked
to Tom.</p>

<p>“If it comes to that I’ll remember Spudger’s,”
grinned the high school lad.</p>

<p>“We can’t have any fellows on our ball
nine that measure over six feet three inches,”
said Blake.</p>

<p>“Ball nine—ball nine!” queried Joe.
“What ball nine?”</p>

<p>“This tall Indian here has started one on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
paper,” put in Victor. “He’s spoiled about a
hundred perfectly good sheets. Why? Can
you play?”</p>

<p>“Kin I play?” echoed Joe. “Well—some.”</p>

<p>“In the major league class, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Joe grinned.</p>

<p>“Here, here, gentlemen,” exclaimed Victor,
“I hereby propose that the managing director
of Clifton’s great baseball nine immediately
gets an option on the services of one Joseph
Rodgers, Esquire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t I wish I could play ball and
enjoy myself like other boys,” sighed the
young giant.</p>

<p>“But think how awful it would be when
you had to slide for second base,” laughed
Victor.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I like to go to school an’ git on
a team,” murmured Joe, staring moodily at
the ground.</p>

<p>“Stranger things have happened, Joe,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“It will never happen to me if Whiffin kin
prevent it,” sniffed the circus boy.</p>

<p>“Brace up, lad,” said Ormond de Sylveste,
in a kindly tone. “At one time I was poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
and ignorant, too. But there is always a
chance for the most obscure to become the
most prominent. I don’t wish to boast, gentlemen,
but I venture to say that in my own
profession there are few who dare assert their
supremacy over me, and——”</p>

<p>“Say, is Bill Potts in there!” a disagreeable
voice suddenly thundered. “By Jingo,
I thought so! Ketched ag’in! If that fat
barker stays here any longer there won’t be a
man in the show workin’. I guess Joe’ll expect
to be President of the United States next.
I don’t want no idlin’ around this tent, understan’,
an’——”</p>

<p>“A little politeness, sir!” expostulated the
bareback rider, with dignity.</p>

<p>“I never heard the beat o’ that,” exclaimed
Whiffin. His voice indicated great surprise.
“Even Bill Potts is a-borrowin’ nerve from
the fat one. You want ter git out o’ them
fancy clothes o’ yourn, an’ buckle down to
some real work.”</p>

<p>For an instant it actually looked as if Ormond
de Sylveste was about to make some
fiery retort, but, apparently changing his
mind, he bowed to his new acquaintances and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
strode moodily away, the picture of outraged
dignity.</p>

<p>“If you don’t take them there ‘stars’ down
onc’t in a while yer couldn’t live in the same
tent with ’em, they’d git that uppish,” came
from Mr. Whiffin.</p>

<p>“Some allowances must be made for genius,”
laughed Dave. “Come on, fellows. I’m
almost famished.”</p>

<p>“Be sure to come and see me again,” cried
the treble voice of “Little” Georgy.</p>

<p>Outside the tent, Dave led the way to the
nearest restaurant with remarkable speed.</p>

<p>“Tom,” he said, “when you become a great
physician, if some of your patients have no
appetite advise them to take a two or three
day course of barking. Boys, I can eat twice
as much as before.”</p>

<p>“I have always suspected where Brandon’s
cash went,” chirped Victor.</p>

<p>After leaving the restaurant the boys wandered
around town until it was time for Dave’s
duties to begin. Tom would have had no objection
to seeing another performance, but
this idea receiving no encouragement from the
others, he proposed going to a hotel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“I’ve got some letters to write to the fellows
at school,” he said.</p>

<p>The boys found a hotel near by, and, later
on in the evening, leaving Tom hard at work
scribbling, they strolled over to the circus
grounds.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” laughed Dave, who had been
looking for them, “I have resumed my occupation
of gentleman and scholar. My connection
with Ollie Spudger’s Great Combined
Peerless Circus and Menagerie has unexpectedly
ended. Jack Gray, having recovered
his voice, will in future speak from the rostrum.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was a jolly good lark, anyway,”
remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“How can you tear yourself away from
Mister Joe Rodgers?” asked Victor.</p>

<p>“He’s a good little chap,” declared Dave,
“and ought to amount to something if he
should have an opportunity. There doesn’t
seem much chance for him here, although
Whiffin isn’t such a bad fellow when one gets
to understand him.”</p>

<p>By the gracious permission of Mr. Ollie
Spudger, the boys were permitted to enter the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
tent so that they might say good-bye to the
young giant.</p>

<p>“Little” Georgy seemed almost on the
point of blubbering as he shook hands. Joe
Rodgers was soon found. Joe’s face wore a
strange expression.</p>

<p>“So you are goin’ ter git, eh, fellows?” he
remarked, slowly. “I’m mighty glad I met
this here bunch. Maybe I’ll see you ag’in
some day.”</p>

<p>“And by that time Brandon might give
you a job as his private secretary,” laughed
Victor.</p>

<p>When the crowd returned to the hotel they
found that Tom’s literary labors were not yet
concluded. The others, however, having decided
that it was time to turn in, pen, ink and
paper were promptly wrested from him.</p>

<p>“If I don’t get some rest soon,” declared
Dave, “I’ll be in danger of going to sleep right
here.”</p>

<p>Although this appeal was heeded, the task
of awakening the historian next morning
proved to be one of heroic proportions.</p>

<p>“Oh ho!” he yawned, at last wearily
dragging himself to his feet, in answer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
their repeated knocking. “All right, Bob!
No; you needn’t batter down the door. I’m
coming directly.”</p>

<p>In spite of his objections breakfast was
hurried through with unseemly haste, and a
quick start made for the garage.</p>

<p>There, they jumped into a machine looking
as spick and span as though it had just come
from the salesroom.</p>

<p>“And this time I do hope we manage to
reach Milwaukee,” said Victor.</p>

<p>“If Tom doesn’t get out of our sight we
may,” laughed Charlie.</p>

<p>As the car whirled along the street Spudger’s
tents were brought into view again, but none
of those whom they had met could be seen.</p>

<p>“Poor old Joe,” sighed Dave. “I’m afraid
he’ll never get that chance he wants so badly.”</p>

<p>With but a few vehicles on the long, straight
road the motor car leaped forward at a rate
which caused the miles to slip by with astonishing
rapidity. Before the noon hour it
rolled across the East Water Street bridge, and
soon stopped in front of the garage where it
had been previously left.</p>

<p>“Now we want to see Uncle Ralph the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
quickest ever!” exclaimed Victor, flicking a
few spots of mud from his clothes. “By
George, it seems like an age since I was on
board that yacht.”</p>

<p>“A few more weeks of the same stuff would
make you a strong, husky chap,” said Tom,
loftily.</p>

<p>“Like yourself, I suppose?” gurgled Victor.</p>

<p>As the boys trooped into the hotel, perhaps
with a trifle more noise and hilarity than was
necessary, they heard a sonorous voice exclaim:</p>

<p>“Well, well; here you are, at last!”</p>

<p>Captain Bunderley, his weather-beaten face
wreathed in smiles, stamped forward. He
seized Victor Collins’ hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen you looking better, lad!”
he said. “I want to hear all about those
wonderful experiences you’ve been having.
Traveling with a circus, eh? And, Bob, I’d
like to know how you managed to find each
other.”</p>

<p>He led the way to the reception room,
motioned them to seats and selected a divan
on which to place his own heavy form.</p>

<p>“Sail ahead,” he commanded. “No tacking,
now; run right before the wind.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>Upon Dave fell the rôle of principal spokesman.
The stout boy’s broad smile grew
broader as he proceeded. Captain Bunderley’s
deep-throated laughter boomed out at frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>“Capital—capital! You’ll do, my boy!”
he exclaimed. “’Pon my word, you ought to
succeed in life.”</p>

<p>“Not even an aeroplane could keep him
down!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>Bob Somers, too, had a great deal to say, and
by lunch time Uncle Ralph had learned everything
worth knowing and much else besides.</p>

<p>Finally he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I have a little business to attend to this
afternoon, so we’ll get something to eat at
once,” he said.</p>

<p>“I was just about to suggest it myself,”
murmured Dave.</p>

<p>The dining-room, with its ornate columns
and rich decorations of the Louis XV period,
was a very attractive-looking place. It suited
Dave’s artistic eye to a nicety. A sigh of contentment
came from his lips as he took a seat
at a table by the window.</p>

<p>Course after course was placed before them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
and the coffee stage of the proceedings had
just arrived when the sound of loud voices in
the corridor attracted general attention.</p>

<p>“Don’t go in there, boy,” exclaimed a commanding
voice. “Get right out of this hotel!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t goin’ to, I tells yer. I know this
is the place ’cause he told me he was comin’
here hisself.”</p>

<p>“There’s some mistake, boy; none of our
guests could possibly want to see you.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re foolin’ yerself. The
clerk says he’s in the eatin’ parlor. I’ll wait
outside while you goes in an’ looks around.
He’s a big fat feller with a round face.”</p>

<p>“You’re the most impudent little rooster
I’ve ever met. I’ll do nothing of the sort.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll do it myself.”</p>

<p>There was the sound of a struggle.</p>

<p>“Grab him, Richards!” bawled the same
loud voice. “Quick!”</p>

<p>Following this came a snort of indignation
and disgust, and the eyes of every one in the
room, focused on the doorway, saw a stocky,
freckle-faced boy swinging recklessly into the
room, with the faultlessly-dressed manager
close at his heels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Come back!” ordered the latter, angrily.</p>

<p>“Not on yer life! I sees him. There he
is by the winder. Hello, Dave!”</p>

<p>Yes—actually—Joe Rodgers, flaming red
vest, big brass buttons and all, had invaded
the fashionable dining-room of a fashionable
hotel, and, unabashed by his surroundings or
by the looks on the faces of the horrified guests
and waiters, was steering as straight a course
as he could for the table at which Captain
Bunderley and the boys were seated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>THE ARM OF THE LAW</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I know’d</span> I’d see ’im!” cried Joe, exultingly.
“I know’d it! That chump a-chasin’
me says ter git, but I up an’ comes in jist the
same.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, gentlemen!” exclaimed
the agitated manager. “I assure you that it
is not our fault; you see, the young——”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, sir!” boomed Captain Bunderley.</p>

<p>“Oh,—oh!” gasped the manager. “I’m
gratified to hear it.”</p>

<p>Red-faced and flustered he promptly turned
away.</p>

<p>Joe, with as little ceremony as though he
was in the menagerie tent, drew up a chair,
plumped himself down upon it and laid his
cap across one knee. Then, having stared at
the captain with solemn earnestness for a moment,
blurted out:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“Dave, I’ve shook Whiffin!”</p>

<p>“What! Left the show?” cried the historian.
“You don’t mean it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I sure have, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is a big surprise, all right,”
quoth Tom.</p>

<p>“It isn’t to me,” giggled Victor. “I had an
idea last night that Dave’s particular crony
was up to something desperate.”</p>

<p>“I presume this is the boy you told me
about?” broke in Captain Bunderley.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Permit me to formally introduce
Mr. Joseph Rodgers, of Iowa,” laughed Victor.</p>

<p>“What made you leave the show?” asked
the captain.</p>

<p>“Him!”</p>

<p>Joe’s brown finger pointed straight toward
Dave Brandon.</p>

<p>“I made you leave?” cried Dave. “How?”</p>

<p>“’Cause, when I meets a feller what’s got
learnin’ like you, I couldn’t stan’ it no longer.
I wants ter be somethin’.”</p>

<p>Captain Bunderley was interested.</p>

<p>“Joe, your desire to rise is commendable,”
he exclaimed, heartily. “Have you ever
spoken to Mr. Whiffin about it?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“I begins to talk to ’im this mornin’, an’
he ups an’ gits riled ter beat the band. ‘I
wish’t I’d never laid eyes on that fat feller,’
says he. ‘Brandon’s been puttin’ all them
fool notions inter your head.’ ‘Look ’ere,
Whiffin,’ says I, ‘don’t you never say nothin’
ag’in ’im; he’s the whitest chap I ever see.’”</p>

<p>“So I have a champion at last,” chuckled
Dave.</p>

<p>“Then Whiffin hollers fer me ter git back
ter work or he’d fetch me a good one on the
ear. That makes me most bile over—him—Whiffin,
talkin’ like that! So I skips right
out.”</p>

<p>“How’d you get here—board a fast freight?”
inquired Victor.</p>

<p>“I did not. I stepped inter a real car, with
real winders an’ real seats, an’ I’ve got seventy-five
cents left.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, what a risk—floating around in
a real city with that much real money in your
pocket!” said Victor.</p>

<p>Joe’s thoughts were on something else.</p>

<p>“Gee, I can most see Whiffin hollerin’ his
way around the show an’ askin’ everybody if
they’ve seen that young scamp, Joe! My, I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
bet he’s so mad he’s clean forgot that quarter
he give to Dave the other night.”</p>

<p>“What do you expect to do in Milwaukee?”
asked Captain Bunderley.</p>

<p>“Do!” echoed Joe, rather blankly. “I
dunno!” Thoughtfully, he ran his fingers
through his bushy hair. “I—I—kinder
thought as how Dave could tell me.”</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Whiffin any claim on your services?”</p>

<p>“Nix; he certainly ain’t,” asserted Joe, with
considerable emphasis.</p>

<p>“Is the circus coming here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! Day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll look after you till then.” Uncle
Ralph beckoned to a waiter. “What will you
have to eat, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Eat! Me eat in a—a—place like this?”
stammered Joe, for the first time abashed.</p>

<p>“Certainly! Why not? Order just what
you please.”</p>

<p>Joe stared from one to another as though
he feared that his ears were deceiving him.
Then his eyes fell on the waiter, whose professional
dignity was sadly shocked by the presence
before him of such an uncouth specimen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“Gimme a great big hunk o’ bread an’
cheese an’ a piece o’ real apple pie, with no
skimpin’ o’ the apples, neither,” he said, “an’
a glass o’ water twic’t. Thankin’ you kindly,
mister; I won’t do nothin’ to that pile o’
grub when it comes.”</p>

<p>“And you may add to that order plenty of
roast beef and potatoes,” added the captain.
“I have an idea that our friend has a famous
appetite.”</p>

<p>Joe Rodgers had never really lived until
that afternoon. He seemed to be fairly lifted
out of himself, and a side of life was revealed
which he had never before dreamed could exist.</p>

<p>“Honest, Dave,” he declared emphatically,
“I can’t never go back to Spudger’s.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see if anything can be done to help
you,” said Dave, encouragingly. “But you
ought not to have run away. Anyhow, fellows,
I propose that we invite Joe to see the
sights of Milwaukee from a seat in the motor
car.”</p>

<p>Even Victor Collins made no objection. He
was beginning to realize that character counts
for more than appearance, and that the passport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
to respectable society consists of something
besides good clothes.</p>

<p>Presently, leaving Captain Bunderley in
the reading room, the boys walked briskly
out upon the street.</p>

<p>At the garage Joe became immensely interested
in the automobile.</p>

<p>“It’s the finest I ever see,” he cried, admiringly.
“Looks most too good to use.”</p>

<p>“Climb in, Joe,” commanded Bob.</p>

<p>He sprang to his place in the driver’s seat,
pushed the button on the dash, and, immediately,
the thunderous din of the motor echoed
from every side and corner of the big interior.</p>

<p>“You’ve got ter know somethin’ to be an
engineer of one o’ these things,” exclaimed
Joe. “Still, I wouldn’t be a bit skeered to
try my hand at drivin’.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing like a motor car to chase
dull care away,” said Dave, who was reclining
at ease on the rear cushions. “Let’s see:
what does Bryant say——?”</p>

<p>“Nothing about motor cars, that’s quite
sure,” laughed Bob, as the wheels began to
revolve.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p284.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HE SPRANG TO HIS PLACE</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>Many vehicles and pedestrians were about,
and warning blasts of the horn were often
sounded. But the boys, not being in any
particular hurry, gave Chauffeur Somers an
easy job, following whichever streets their
fancy dictated.</p>

<p>“This is rippin’!” cried Joe, enthusiastically.
“Feels jist like gittin’ boosted along
without nothin’ doin’ it.”</p>

<p>The car slowly rolled through the business
section, giving them interesting glimpses of
attractive stores and windows filled with all
sorts of goods. They crossed and recrossed
the Milwaukee River, and, finally, on one of
the more quiet streets, were bowling steadily
along when the actions of a certain policeman
attracted Bob Somers’ attention. He was
standing by the curb with his eyes eagerly
fixed on the approaching car.</p>

<p>“Hey there,” came a loud command.
“Stop!”</p>

<p>“Is he speaking to us?” inquired Bob,
turning to his companions with a puzzled
look. He glanced about, and, seeing no other
vehicles near, answered his own question.
“Yes, he certainly is.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“Have we busted any traffic regulations, I
wonder?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s ’cause we haven’t got no cow-catcher,”
said Joe, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Hey there—stop!”</p>

<p>The man in uniform was stepping out into
the street, the significant movement of his
arm indicating an authority not to be questioned.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha—somebody’s pinched—jugged!”
cried Joe. “Is this the feller you want?”
His finger dug sharply into Victor Collins’
ribs. “I’ll help you tote him along.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what all this means!”
exclaimed Tom, in his most manly tones.</p>

<p>Bob Somers smilingly awaited an explanation.</p>

<p>The policeman, looking searchingly at each
in turn, took from his pocket a memorandum
book. Then, glancing over the pages, gave a
grunt of approval.</p>

<p>“Correct, all right. Descriptions and license
number correspond.”</p>

<p>This information, while interesting, did not
enlighten the boys as to the meaning of his
strange action.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>“Would you have any objection to telling
us why we’ve been stopped?” drawled Dave,
from the rear.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we ought to stand for anything
like this,” growled Tom, bristling up in
a very threatening fashion.</p>

<p>“Which one o’ ’em shall I chuck out o’ the
car for yer?” inquired Joe. “You kin take
any but the fat feller.”</p>

<p>The officer glanced at him and wagged his
head knowingly.</p>

<p>“The police station is just around the corner,
boys,” he answered, quietly. “I reckon
the sergeant will tell you what it’s all
about.”</p>

<p>“The idea! Just listen to that!” stormed
Tom. “I’d demand an explanation right
here, Bob Somers. Don’t let those spokes
move even as much as half an inch.”</p>

<p>“If there’s any fightin’ to be done I’m right
here to help you,” laughed Joe.</p>

<p>Dave Brandon smiled languidly.</p>

<p>“In spite of ourselves, we seem destined to
have fame pushed upon us,” he exclaimed.
“It looks as though something is rocking the
pedestal.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“We are too polite not to accept such a pressing
invitation,” grinned Bob Somers.</p>

<p>“All the same, I’ll bet we can sue somebody
for this!” cried Victor. “My father’s best
friend is a United States senator, and he——”</p>

<p>A series of crisp, vibrating notes from the
motor drowned his voice. The car moved
forward, and, always under the watchful eye
of the law, as represented in the person of the
man in uniform, chugged its way around the
corner, to presently come to a stop before a
building of a dark, unpleasantly grim appearance.</p>

<p>“We know where we’re going, and we’re on
our way!” cried Dave. “All of us wanted in
there, officer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. We won’t steal your car,”
grinned the policeman. “Kindly step out.”</p>

<p>They followed the officer up a broad flight of
stone steps, pushed past a pair of swinging
doors and entered a large square room. At
one end two desks stood on a platform with
an ornamental railing in front.</p>

<p>Several policemen lounging on a bench
looked up with interest as the crowd marched
across the floor. A large, stout man, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
iron gray hair and mustache sitting behind
one of the desks glanced inquiringly at the
officer.</p>

<p>“These are the boys mentioned in the telegram,
sergeant,” explained the policeman.
“Description of the one that’s wanted just
fits.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand toward Joe Rodgers.</p>

<p>“Me—me?” cried Joe. Then an inkling
of the true situation for the first time dawned
upon him. “Oh, Dave, I’m ketched!” he
exclaimed, almost pitifully. “Whiffin’s done
it. I might have know’d he would! But I
ain’t never goin’ back—perlice, or no perlice,”
he added.</p>

<p>Joe, blank with despair, as new-found hopes
were shaken, stared moodily at the floor.</p>

<p>“Now I suppose you’ll have to get a hundred
thousand dollars bail, Rodgers,” said
Victor. “Of course, this is one of the most
important cases of the year.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s he goin’ to do with me?”
demanded Joe. “I’m goin’ ter stand up for
me rights.”</p>

<p>“You must be detained until the arrival of
the complainant”—the sergeant glanced at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
a paper in his hand—“Peter Whiffin. You
look like a respectable crowd of boys,” he
added, taking a careful observation of the
faces before him.</p>

<p>“I’ve never pinched a better lot,” agreed the
policeman.</p>

<p>“Sergeant, may I have the use of your
’phone for a moment?” spoke up Dave.</p>

<p>“Certainly!” answered the official.</p>

<p>In a short time Dave, his mouth at the
transmitter, was explaining matters to Captain
Bunderley.</p>

<p>“Says he’ll be over here within an hour,”
he announced, hanging up the receiver.
“No; he didn’t seem surprised, Bob. I guess
the captain is too old to be surprised at anything.”</p>

<p>The crowd took seats on a bench, their
lively conversation soon helping to cheer up
the dejected Joe Rodgers. But even then he
found the long wait trying to his nerves.</p>

<p>At length Uncle Ralph tramped noisily
into the room.</p>

<p>“It just shows how careful one must be in
forming new acquaintances, boys,” he chuckled.
“I’ve only known you for a few days—yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
here I find myself in a police station, and all
on your account. What’s to be done, sergeant,
with such a reckless lot?”</p>

<p>“That’s a hard one to answer,” grinned the
official.</p>

<p>“Well, now, let’s get right down to business.
When will Mr. Whiffin be here? I’ve
become interested in this boy, sergeant, and
I don’t propose to let all the talking be on
one side.”</p>

<p>“By Jingo, if you’ll only stand up for me,
mister, I’ll never forgit it!” cried Joe.</p>

<p>“I hope you’re going to make a base hit,
Rodgers,” laughed Tom.</p>

<p>“Mr. Whiffin will be here to-morrow
morning,” explained the sergeant. “Until
then the boy will have to remain with us.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll be here, too, with this strong-arm
squad,” laughed the captain, “ready to
face the manager of Spudger’s Peerless show.”</p>

<small>THE JUDGE INTERFERES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gloomy weather was over at last. Puddles
and pools were fast drying up in the
warmth of pleasant sunshine, while a balmy
breeze had replaced the blustery wind.</p>

<p>“Say, Bob Somers,” remarked Victor Collins,
as all were on their way to the police
station next morning, “didn’t I hear you
’phoning to some one last night?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, Vic.”</p>

<p>“Who was it?”</p>

<p>“You may know before the morning is
over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, Somers, tell me.”</p>

<p>“No; not a word, Vic,” answered Bob,
smilingly.</p>

<p>The large, square room in the police station
looked very differently from the way it had
on the afternoon before. Already it contained
a large number of people, and in the buzz of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
conversation, the light footfalls, and the appearance
of a solemn magistrate’s clerk poring
over a great ledger, there was something which
filled those whose nerves were not of the
strongest with a curious feeling of restraint.</p>

<p>As each new arrival entered the room
tongues were stilled for the instant, for the
magistrate was due to arrive.</p>

<p>Joe Rodgers, in spite of the boys’ support
and encouragement, lacked the air of rugged
bravado which usually characterized him.</p>

<p>“I don’t wanter go back to Whiffin, fellers,”
he wailed, continually. “But I know that
he’s goin’ to put up an awful holler, ’cause
when I gits down to work I kin do a turrible
lot.”</p>

<p>“Brace up, Joe,” said Dave. “You are
not back in the circus yet.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of voices and footsteps
at the door much louder than any which had
come before caused that particular part of the
room to become the target of many eyes.</p>

<p>A large, portly man entered and directed
his footsteps straight toward the desk behind
the railing. This, and the hush which immediately
ensued, proclaimed him to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
magistrate. Closely following came Peter
Whiffin and Mr. Ollie Spudger.</p>

<p>The former’s eyes were instantly roving
about the room, and his keen gaze soon picked
out from the throng the forms of Joe Rodgers
and his friends.</p>

<p>“There he is, Spudger!” he exclaimed, in
a voice which rang through the room with
appalling distinctness. “He runned away,
all right, but he didn’t git very far. Here,
you, boy”—he advanced, with his finger
poised threateningly in the air—“it’s back to
the canvas tents for you. Come right along.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t goin’ to!” growled Joe.</p>

<p>“Uncle Ralph, permit me to introduce Mr.
Whiffin, of somewhere,” chirped Victor Collins.</p>

<p>The circus manager glared at the burly
skipper.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded, roughly.
“What does this mean?”</p>

<p>Captain Bunderley was disposed to be diplomatic.</p>

<p>“I’m here in the interests of this boy, Mr.
Whiffin,” he said, politely.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t see that it’s any of your
affair.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“Decidedly not!” seconded Mr. Spudger.</p>

<p>“This here fat Brandon filled his head
chuck full of nonsense, an’, as if that weren’t
bad enough, he gits him to actually run away—run
away from his best friend. Why, I could
have the law on ’im!”</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do with it, Mr. Whiffin,”
answered Dave.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out, now. Yer can’t fool me.
Yer took ’im right along in the automobile.
I know yer did.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t nothin’ of the sort, Whiffin!”
cried Joe. “I rid on the train. An’ I kin
prove it.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Mr. Whiffin. In spite
of his suspicions, there was something in Joe’s
earnest manner which impelled him to accept
his words as the truth. “What! An’ you
wasted good money that way? It’s perfectly
outrageous, that’s what it is.”</p>

<p>“Order—order!”</p>

<p>A gavel banged with explosive force against
the desk. The magistrate was speaking, and
in such a tone that even Mr. Whiffin felt
called upon to moderate his voice.</p>

<p>While the hearings went on, he pleaded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
threatened and expostulated with Joe, curtly
declining to listen to any of Uncle Ralph’s
suggestions. And every argument which the
manager advanced Joe, who stood backed up
against the wall, met with this reply:</p>

<p>“Naw, I ain’t a-goin’ ter do it!”</p>

<p>“Well, then you’ll go right up before the
magistrate,” declared Mr. Whiffin. “I reckon
you’ll listen to him, all right.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only thing that will put any sense
into his head,” agreed Mr. Spudger.</p>

<p>But even this prospect did not make Joe
waver.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a tongue in me head, an’ kin use
it,” he exclaimed, defiantly.</p>

<p>“Joseph Rodgers!”</p>

<p>This name called out in the monotonous
tones of the clerk finally brought all before
the rail.</p>

<p>“Where is the complainant, Peter Whiffin?”
asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Right here,” answered the manager.</p>

<p>“Has this matter been settled? That’s the
boy, I suppose? Is he your ward?”</p>

<p>“I’m jist as much his guardeen as if it had
been writ on paper,” asserted Peter Whiffin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
vigorously. “I’ve got a letter from his uncle
to show how things stand. An’, besides, I’ve
given ’im his grub an’ clothes for years.”</p>

<p>“An’ ain’t I worked an’ worked until me
hands was blistered to pieces?” screeched
Joe.</p>

<p>“I think there ought to be no difficulty in
coming to some amicable agreement about the
boy,” broke in Captain Bunderley. “We do
not wish to infringe on any one’s rights, but
all of us think that his future should be given
some consideration. My young friend here”—he
indicated Dave—“will guarantee to find
him work in his home town, so that he will
have an opportunity to attend school.”</p>

<p>“By gum!” cried Joe, his eyes sparkling,
“jist listen to that!”</p>

<p>“An’ I kin say there’s nothin’ doin’,” said
Mr. Whiffin, explosively.</p>

<p>“Produce that letter you spoke about,”
returned the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said Mr. Whiffin.</p>

<p>The official’s eyes ran over the contents.</p>

<p>“All it seems to show is that the boy’s
guardian knows he is with you,” he said,
slowly. “But, still, I hardly think that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
have any authority to take him from under
your care and protection.”</p>

<p>The expression on Joe Rodgers’ face, which
a moment before had been so full of hope,
changed to one of blank despair.</p>

<p>“Have you been ill-treated, Joe?” asked
the magistrate, in kindly tones.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I ain’t.”</p>

<p>“What’s your complaint, then?”</p>

<p>“If I stays with ’im I won’t never have no
chanc’t to git an eddication, an’——”</p>

<p>“That is a pity. But it is not enough to
justify me in taking any action. Perhaps
you may be able to make some arrangement
with Mr. Whiffin so that you can go to school
in the winter.”</p>

<p>“Your Honor, I have a word to say about
this case.”</p>

<p>A strong, clear voice attracted the attention
of every one in the court room. They
saw a tall, commanding-looking man step
before the rail; and they also saw the magistrate
stare at him with an air of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Judge Hampton!” he stammered.</p>

<p>The former jurist nodded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>“I appear before you as the representative
of Joe Rodgers.”</p>

<p>“And now I know who the big Indian was
’phoning to last night,” said Victor, in a loud
whisper.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s the time Bob made a safe hit,”
murmured Tom.</p>

<p>Mr. Whiffin’s face expressed a comical
degree of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“What—what?” he gasped. “I’d like to
know what right you have to meddle in this
case!”</p>

<p>“Here’s a letter which Mr. Whiffin received
from the boy’s uncle,” said the magistrate,
handing the missive to the former
jurist.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence while Judge
Hampton was reading it.</p>

<p>“You are in a pretty poor position, sir,” he
said, looking up from the sheet and addressing
Mr. Whiffin. “This amounts to nothing.
The duties and responsibilities of guardianship
cannot be so lightly thrust into another’s
hands by a relative.”</p>

<p>Mr. Whiffin glared savagely.</p>

<p>“I tell you I won’t stand for anything like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
this!” he cried. “Judge or no judge, I have
my rights.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll back you up to the limit,” said
Mr. Spudger, who could see, in the way events
were shaping themselves, that the circus was
in danger of losing the services of one who
had been trained in the business.</p>

<p>“I feel that the advantages which this boy
may gain will so far offset any mere personal
loss to Mr. Whiffin that I must ask your
Honor to parole Joe Rodgers into the care of
Captain Bunderley until his relatives can be
communicated with.”</p>

<p>“Request granted!” exclaimed the magistrate.</p>

<p>Joe, highly delighted, grasped Dave Brandon
by the arm.</p>

<p>“Dave,” he said, huskily, “you’re the best
feller in the whole world.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>JOE’S CHANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Bunderley</span>, assuming charge of
the Joe Rodgers case, a cause celebre on account
of Judge Hampton’s participation in it,
within a few days had received the following
letter from a small village in Iowa:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—</p>

<p>“In regards to Joe Rodgers, my wife
says if you can do better for him than Mr.
Whiffin, and he can get some education, take
the kid, and welcome. I guess he don’t owe
Whiffin nothing.</p>

<p>“Maybe Joe ought to have a chance, as you
say. But circumstances didn’t allow me to
keep him, and knocking around the world
ain’t good for a boy.</p>

<p>“Hoping that when he learns to write he’ll
send me a letter, I am,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Respectfully yours,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Ben Hankerson</span>.</p>

<p>“P. S. Of course I’ll expect to hear straight
ahead how he’s getting along.”</p>
</div>

<p>That same afternoon all parties concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
met in the magistrate’s private office. Mr.
Whiffin’s bellicose air had somewhat subsided,
partly due to the fact that he had consulted a
lawyer and received no encouragement.</p>

<p>“If I knew that the fat feller had made him
run away I’d fight the case to the end,” he
confided to Mr. Spudger. “But, bein’ as the
kid says he didn’t—an’ he’s pretty straight
goods regardin’ the truth—I guess I’ll have to
pass him up.”</p>

<p>“And, after all, Whiffin,” said Spudger, reflectively,
“the boy will get the chance he
wants.”</p>

<p>“He sure could never make no animal
tamer nor performer, an’ he ain’t got the face
for a ringmaster,” said Peter Whiffin. “No;
it would be the big wagon and long drives for
him. Besides, the show business ain’t what
it used ter be.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t nothin’ what is,” said Mr.
Spudger. “An’ I guess they said the same
thing a hundred years ago.”</p>

<p>Judge Hampton had been quietly consulting
with the magistrate and Captain Bunderley.
Bluff and hearty, Captain Bunderley’s
part in the conference had not been quiet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>“It will be the best thing in the world for
the boy,” he said. “He has strength and
ambition; and those are the only two things
an American boy needs to make him a success
in life.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Whiffin”—the former judge turned
toward the showman—“our proposal is this:
work will be found for Joe at Kingswood,
Wisconsin, and he will be given an opportunity
to attend school. You, as a man of
the world, must know that this is the best
thing to do.”</p>

<p>“I can’t fight ag’in a dozen,” answered Mr.
Whiffin. “An’ I know that the boy’s head
will be so turned after all this fuss over him
that he’d never do a lick o’ work right ag’in.”</p>

<p>“By gum, I can’t hardly believe that sich
good luck has come to me,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“You kin begin to believe it right now,”
remarked Mr. Spudger. “An’ don’t never
forgit that you owe everything to Whiffin an’
me; because if you hadn’t been with the
show this wouldn’t have happened.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s quite true,” assented Captain
Bunderley. “You do owe them a great deal.
Shake hands with your former employers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
Joe. On such an auspicious occasion for you
there must be no ill-feeling.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Joe, heartily.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got none—not a bit of it,” said Mr.
Peter Whiffin, extending two bony fingers.
“What riled me at first was to think that
Brandon should have inweigled him inter
running off.”</p>

<p>“An’ Joe beating it without so much as
leavin’ a card of regrets,” growled Mr. Spudger.</p>

<p>“But as it’s all for the boy’s good, I’m
game. Good luck, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Whiffin, you’re all right, twic’t!” exclaimed
Joe Rodgers. “You’ll find I’m goin’
to amount to somethin’, an’ we’ll always be
frens.”</p>

<p>Yes, Joe Rodgers’ chance had come at last.
Through his fortunate meeting with Dave
Brandon he would be able to gratify his ambition
to go to school.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to keep an eye on you,”
exclaimed Captain Bunderley, when they had
taken leave of Judge Hampton and the circus
men. “Before many months are over you’ll
find me turning up at the school. And if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
don’t hear a good account of you there’ll be
trouble.”</p>

<p>“And just to think,” remarked Dave, reflectively,
“that to-morrow we’ll be leaving
for our home in Kingswood! Seems funny,
Bob, but I thought this part of our trip would
only add a few pages to my history. But——”</p>

<p>“It means a thousand, at least,” broke in
Tom, with a laugh. “When it’s finished it’ll
be as long as an encyclopedia, and lots more
exciting.”</p>

<p>The boys felt rather sober when the time
came next morning to say good-bye to Captain
Bunderley and Victor Collins. Each had
taken a great fancy to the bluff old skipper,
and, strangely enough, Victor seemed to have
become a very different sort of a boy from the
one who had begun the trip with them.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” he remarked, as he shook
hands warmly with Bob Somers, “you can
count on seeing me again. I’m kind of curious
to take a look at that high school. I’ve
found that you’re the kind of chaps who improve
on acquaintance. Dave is certainly a
winner.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be delighted to see you, Vic,” returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
Bob. “And perhaps you’ll find that
Kingswood isn’t such a slow place, after all.”</p>

<p>As long as the crowd was within sight of
the hotel they saw Victor standing on the
steps waving his hand.</p>

<p>“The worst of traveling around like this,”
said Tom, “is that you meet a lot of fellows,
and just as soon as you get to like them to
beat the band you have to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I noticed you liked Victor well
enough at one time to want to hit him on the
eye,” exclaimed Blake. And this remark
Tom passed by with haughty silence.</p>

<p>Once more they were at the garage; and
once more they jumped into the car. The
blasts of the horn which had grown so familiar
to their ears again warned the passers-by
of their approach.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the city, Tom, who was
sitting behind Dave, touched the stout boy on
the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Look at Blake,” he exclaimed, in a low
tone. “Honest—being with this crowd has
certainly done him a lot of good.”</p>

<p>The usually timid “grind” had exchanged
places with Bob Somers and was actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
driving the car at a good clip along a street
which was by no means deserted. And, more
than that, Blake looked as unconcerned as
though handling a big touring car was the
easiest thing in the world.</p>

<p>“A few more months,” went on Tom, loftily,
“and that yellow streak some of the boys
talked about couldn’t be found with a microscope.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Dave. “All Charlie
needs is a bit of encouragement, and he will
be a mighty useful member of our ball team.
What were you saying, Joe?”</p>

<p>“That I jist feel like yelling for all I’m
worth.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t do it now,” laughed Dave.
“I’m most uncommonly sleepy, and this delightful
motion is calling me to the land of
nod.”</p>

<p>“Make the most of it, Dave,” cried Bob,
from the front seat, “for the Rambler Club’s
motor car is taking us nearer and nearer to
the place where mighty little nodding can be
done.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” drawled the stout boy, “and
I shall assert my rights.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>In spite of Dave’s admonition Joe could not
restrain a joyous shout.</p>

<p>And it was astonishing how that reckless
Charlie Blake increased his speed after they
had turned into a long, straight country road.
Many a person stopped to look after the flying
car, which kept steadily on and on until lost
to view in the distance.</p>
